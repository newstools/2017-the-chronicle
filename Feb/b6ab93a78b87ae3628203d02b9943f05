Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter PACE bowlers Richard Ngarava and Carl Mumba have been included in the Zimbabwe cricket squad ahead of the five One Day International series against Afghanistan which gets underway at Harare Sports Club tomorrow. Left-arm seamer Ngarava, a part of the Zimbabwe A side which lost 4-1 in a five-match 50-over contest against Afghanistan A, was member of the country s Under-19 at last year&#8217;s World Cup in Bangladesh.The 19-year-old, still to earn his debut in ODIs, is well known for being a victim of the contentious Mankand dismissal when West Indies bowler Keemo Paul ran him out at the non-striker s end for backing too far off the crease during a Group C match.Zimbabwe lost that contest by two runs and missed out on a place in the quarter-finals.West Indies eventually went on to win the tournament.Mumba, a lanky pace bowler, earned his international cricket break against Sri Lanka in the two Tests played at Harare Sports Club in November last year.The 21-year old played his only ODI in the first match of the Tri-Nation Series against Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club on 14 November during which he bowled four overs at the cost of 31 runs without taking a wicket.The addition of the two bowlers has come as a surprise since it was hugely expected that the slots that had been left open for those who did in the domestic 50 over competition were going to be filled by batsmen.Sean Williams, Brian Chari, Hamilton Masakadza, Tafara Mupariwa and Regis Chakabva were some of the batsmen who had put in performances good enough to be considered for selection.It seems coach Heath Streak and the convener of selectors Tatenda Tauibu thought otherwise.Williams, according to Streak, failed a fitness test and might be included in the squad should he pass the assessment.The left-handed batsman turned out for the Bulawayo Metropolitan Tuskers in the two 50-over domestic matches at Queens Sports Club.Tuskers defeated Midlands Rhinos and Manicaland Mountaineers by identical margins of six wickets.Zimbabwe squad against AfghanistanGraeme Cremer (captain), Peter Moor (wicketkeeper), Ryan Burl, Tarisai Musakanda, Sikandar Raza, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Wellington Masakadza, Donald Tiripano, Tendai Chatara, Christopher Mpofu, Nathan Waller, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Richard Ngarava, Carl Mumba.
