Elvis MoyoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE heavyweight cage fighter Elvis Moyo has secured a fight against South African Mike Vermeulen at Carnival City in Johannesburg next month. Moyo, whose stage name is Bulawayo Bomber, will be hoping to make up for his Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) Africa title fight loss to Andrew van Zyl in October last year when he comes up against Vermeulen on March 4.In a telephone interview from his Johannesburg base yesterday, Moyo said he needs victory against Vermeulen to get his plan of another title shot back on track. I m excited that I m getting back into the ring after a long time. My last fight was in October as you know, and I lost to van Zyl. I ve been working hard at the gym, doing lots of sparring and I feel I m ready to bring down Vermeulen, Moyo said.Moyo will have to be at his best to overcome Vermeulen, who has four career wins out of five. The South African will also be seeking to stretch his unbeaten run to five fights.What makes Vermeulen a tricky opponent is that he won his last fight in October against Poland s Tomasz Kredka Kowalkowski, who knocked out Moyo in just 37 seconds in 2015.Moyo has seven career wins from 11 cage fights.The Bulawayo Bomber recorded victories over Sors Guru Grobbelaar in his debut cage fight in March 2014, Wilhelm Tiny Strauss in August and Didier-Kilola in November of the same year. He also beat Lance Cerenio in February 2015 and also handed Vandam Mbuyi a defeat in December 2015.He exploded on Ricky Misholas last year in June and in August he beat Japanese mixed martial arts veteran Kiyoshi Tamura in the fourth round in a fight staged in Tokyo.The Bulawayo Bomber lost twice in 2014 to Brendon Groenwald and Andrew van Zyl. His third loss was in June 2015 when he was knocked out by Kowalkowski. He lost to Van Zyl again last year in a title fight.@ZililoR
