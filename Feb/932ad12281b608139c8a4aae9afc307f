Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter GOLD wars between illegal miners fighting for mining claims in the Midlands province have claimed more than 10 lives, displaced 10 residents and resulted in 20 people including three police officers being injured in one year. Over the weekend, police held an outreach programme at Amaveni Shopping Centre in Kwekwe the killings hotspot in a bid to stop the violence. Addressing residents, the Officer Commanding Midlands Province, Senior Assistant Commissioner Abigail Moyo, said there was a ban on the carrying of machetes in the gold mining town. I can confirm that there are around 89 machete cases that have been reported in the province in the past year. Of these cases, at least 10 people have been murdered, 30 injured including three police officers and 10 displaced. To date we have arrested around 20 suspects, she said.Snr Asst Com Moyo said it was a crime for members of the public and especially gold panners to carry machetes or dangerous weapons. She said police were there to protect life, hence communities must work with them. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to members of the public who are assisting us in our policing duties. One such case is when our officer, Constable Mpofu of Zhombe, was attacked with a machete during the festive season. Alert members of the public managed to save him and apprehend the criminal, she said.Snr Asst Com Moyo said it was saddening that Kwekwe residents were living in fear as gold panners engage in a reign of terror.The violence is not only limited to the city centre as it has since spread to the townships with Amaveni being the most affected as most of the panners hail from the city s oldest township.@amanda49
