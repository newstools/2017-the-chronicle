The suspect was arrested after he had escaped to another village and is assisting with investigations, said Asst Insp Dehwa.He said Brilliant Child Pre-school teacher Ms Siyamukhele Mhere (25) of Mhandamabwe Business Centre accompanied her pupils to the toilet. She stumbled on Israel s body wrapped in a comforter. A report was made to the police at Mhandamabwe Base who attended the scene and took the body to Chivi District Hospital mortuary for post-mortem. The body had two deep cuts on the head and on the back of the head and a blood-stained mattock was recovered at the suspect s homestead.
