Our people were fed and they are still being fed. I would like to thank you (President Mugabe) for the deliberate initiative to curb future droughts through Command Agriculture. Our province is proud to be a remarkable success story in the implementation of a prudent drought mitigation programme and through Zim-Asset, Arda/ Antelope in Matobo and Ingwizi in Mangwe have made us proud, he said.Cde Choeni urged the Government to construct more irrigation schemes in the province as a long term solution to ensure food security.
