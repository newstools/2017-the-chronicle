Joseph MuchechetereSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) is set to advertise for the post of director-general to replace Charles Nhemachena who retired in May 2016. Seasoned sports administrator Joseph Muchechetere has been acting director-general since Nhemachena s retirement.Muchechetere is the substantive sports development director in the commission and indications are that he could land the top post on a permanent basis.He is credited with pioneering the Zimbabwe National Youth Games, which began in 2003 in Bulawayo and have been successfully held every other year on a rotational basis in each of the country s 10 provinces. He also oversaw the birth of the Zimbabwe National Paralympics Games in 2008.In an interview with Chronicle Sport on Friday night, SRC board chairman, Edward Siwela said the search for a substantive director-general will begin in earnest this week. We are going to flight adverts this coming week for the director-general post. As you are aware, the process might take some time before the person is appointed as it also needs the input of the minister, said Siwela.The appointment of the director-general is in terms of the SRC Act Chapter 24, which reads: The board shall appoint, subject to this Act and on such terms and conditions as the board, with the approval of the minister, may fix, a person approved by the minister to be the director-general. No person shall be appointed as director-general and no person shall hold office as director-general if he is not ordinarily resident in Zimbabwe. Paragraph 4 of the same chapter says subject to the general control of the board, the director-general shall be responsible for managing the operations, undertakings and property of the commission; and giving effect to the decisions of the board; and supervising and controlling the activities of the employees of the commission in the course of their employment.Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane has indicated that the appointment of the director-general would set in motion full implementation of the sport and recreation policy, which has been approved by Cabinet and awaits implementation. @skhumoyo2000?
