Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter BOTSWANA based Township Rollers Queens are up in arms with the organisers of the 2016 edition of the LM Auctioneers Women s Football Tournament who have not paid them their prize money, two months after the tournament was held in Bulawayo. The revived tournament, bankrolled by former Caps United juniors player Lewis Muzhara, was held on December 18 at Hartsfield Rugby Grounds and saw seven teams in attendance as they all fought for the $3 000 first prize. The runners up ought to have received $1 500.Black Rhinos walloped the Botswana based side 4-0 in a one sided match which, however, saw the visitors Bame Ngenda being voted the Player of the Tournament, an accolade, according to the Township Rollers Queens chairman Edward Obolokile, which carried a prize of $1 500. We have not received our prize money even up to now, we have been making frantic calls to the organisers who keep on shifting goalposts. At one time they told us to meet at the border before changing again and telling us that our money will be deposited into our account, said Obolokile from Francistown, Botswana yesterday.Muzhara, however, claimed he does not owe anyone anything as all the teams were paid what was due to them. Everyone was paid with only individual prizes outstanding due to some delays, said Muzhara.Obolokile said they wanted an amicable solution to the whole impasse and remained hopeful that the sponsors would own up. All we want is what is due to us, this impasse must end in an amicable and friendly manner. They have told us that we must expect something by Monday and if nothing happens then, we will have to sit down as an executive committee and see the next route to take, said Obolokile.Other teams that took part in the tournament are Hearts of Oak, Inline Academy, Chipembere, Blue Swallows and Flame Lily but it could not be established whether they are in the same predicament as the Batswana team.
