&nbsp;Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HEAVY rains have forced the Matabeleland South Cricket Association (Masca) to postpone resumption of its league and schools games. The Masca League, which plays 40 overs games, has five teams, Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic, Gwanda Giants, ZRP Gwanda, Legends and Plumtree.Masca chairman Arthur Maphosa said the games will only resume at the end of the rainy season. Our games are on hold and we will only be able to start when the rains stop. We will have to reschedule our league and (the) schools programme. We have been unable to work on the fields that we use because of the rains. Despite the setback, we are confident of having a successful programme once our games restart, said Maphosa.He said they would play most of their league and schools games at Plumtree High School as part of their drive to promote cricket in the province.Last season matches were played at Portland Primary School in Colleen Bawn.Masca has also set up a committee to fundraise for the rehabilitation of Ncema Cricket Valley Club.Maphosa said rehabilitation of Ncema Cricket Valley Club was likely to encourage the spread of the game in the province as it would ease the burden of travelling for cash-strapped teams since it s a central venue. The problem we are faced with is that cricket is played in Gwanda, Bulilima and Mangwe districts. What we want is for the sport to spread across the province, hence our decision to have almost all the corners of the province playing the sport. Our aim is to conscientise the community, so our coaches are doing ground work at schools in the province for us to have a base for clubs, said Maphosa.Masca wants districts such as Beitbridge and Matobo to compete in its league. @ZililoR
