President Omar al-BashirKhartoum Sudanese are reportedly set to demolish at least 25 Christian churches allegedly said to be trespassing into residential areas . According to Radio Tamazuj, religious leader, Meilad Musa, who is a member of the Sudanese Christian Church, said President Omar al Bashir s led government had been refusing to approve plots for Christians to build places of worship like Muslims.Reverend Yahya Abdurrahman, a pastor of Evangelical Church described the decision as a flagrant violation of religious freedom. This move targets the churches in Khartoum, because they always acclaim that these churches have trespassed into public places, but it I think it s a plan, Yahya was quoted as saying.In 2014, Sudanese authorities issued an order banning the construction of all new Christian churches in the Muslim-dominated country, a report by Christian Post said.Sudanese Minister for Guidance and Religious Endowments, Shalil Abdullah, was at the time quoted as saying that due to the country s separation from South Sudan where many Christians have fled &#8211; the existing churches in the Republic of Sudan were sufficient for the nation s minority Christians.The ban prompted deep concern from rights group.The Chief Operating Officer at Christian Solidarity Worldwide lambasted the move saying that this constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of religion or belief . This policy, and the continued practice of demolishing and confiscating church land, constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of religion or belief, guaranteed in article 6 and 38 of Sudan s Interim Constitution as well as article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Sudan is signatory, Dipper was cited as saying at the time.
