FOUR fine individual performances for Zimbabwe A stood out above the indifferent bowling and fragile top-order batting that were responsible for home side s third successive defeat at the hands of the rampant Afghanistan A team, this time by 20 runs, at Harare Sports Club yesterday. Pride of place goes to Innocent Kaia, whose magnificent innings came through another disastrous top-order collapse by the Zimbabwe A batsmen, and Ryan Burl who played another excellent innings in support.Tendai Chatara began the match with a superb opening spell that removed the Afghan openers for just a single run between them, while Nathan Waller bowled a very tight 10-over spell that his team-mates were unable to copy, and almost brought off an incredible victory at the death.But the bottom line was another defeat for Zimbabwe A and the five-match series to Afghanistan A.There was heavy rain overnight and conditions were still very damp, although the sun was shining, when Zimbabwe A won the toss, and took what appeared to be the wise decision in these circumstances in putting the tourists in to bat, as long as the weather had no more serious shocks in store.Zimbabwe A fielded an unchanged team in this match, despite the dismal performance of most of their leading batsmen thus far in the series.Chatara found the conditions to his liking in his first over, beating the bat a couple of times with movement on the pitch.Off the fifth ball the Afghans new opening batsman Karim Sadiq took what appeared to be a desperate swing at the ball and edged a catch to the keeper Ryan Murray, without a run on the board the only contact bat made with ball during that first over.Chatara continued to relish the conditions, as he struck again in his second over, removing Nasir Khan (1) who edged his defensive stroke to the keeper; three for two wickets.Although the batsmen were fairly comfortable with Neville Madziva, they continued to find it hard to get a full bat on to Chatara s deliveries, and he did not concede a run until the final ball of his fourth over, when Younas Ahmadzai slashed a thick edge through point for four.The Afghans scored only 20 runs off the first 11 overs, but when Carl Mumba replaced Madziva the runs began to flow, and 13 runs came off his second over, 12 of them to Ahmadzai, while Waheedullah Shafaq played a quiet role.Chatara finished his superb opening spell with figures of six overs, three maidens, eight runs for two wickets.The team fifty came up in the 17th over, 34 of them to Ahmadzai, and the pitch was beginning to flatten out now under the warm sun.ScoresAfghanistan A 279 for 4 in 50 overs (Younas Ahmadzai 104, Shafiqullah 70*, Khaibar Omar 54*; Tendai Chatara 2/52, Nathan Waller 1/36) Zimbabwe A 259 for 9 in 50 overs (Innocent Kaia 100, Ryan Burl 70; Nawaz Khan 5/51, Mohammad Ibrahim 2/38) Zim Cricket.
