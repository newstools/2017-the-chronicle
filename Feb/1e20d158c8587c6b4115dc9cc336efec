Ruvheneko ParirenyatwaRADIO personality Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa will today launch her own online television show. Unsurprisingly, the show will be called Ruvheneko and it will be broadcast on online media such as Facebook Live and Instagram.Ruvheneko has already proved that her online shows can be a success and can disrupt traditional television after she used Facebook Live in January to interview controversial hip hop artist Stunner when he was having marital issues with his wife Olinda Chapel.She successfully managed to capture the attention of Zimbabweans when she posed hard hitting questions to Stunner. One of her show s major appeals was to allow the audience to have a say in the proceedings.Ruvheneko realises that some people do not have access to fast and reliable internet connections. As a result, her shows will be uploaded on her YouTube channel for later viewing.Speaking to H-Metro, Ruvheneko said: On Thursday February 2, 2017, I launch my online TV Show called Ruvheneko. It will air online using new media platforms, so go to liking the Facebook page, Ruvheneko so you do not miss a moment. There will also be the use of Twitter and Instagram so follow me there too. We are interactive with our audience as it happens so we get their input on every topic we discuss. Aware that there are millions who are not on any form of social media, the show will be uploaded on my YouTube Channel Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa for later viewing.Doing her show online means that the Iron Lady as Ruvheneko is affectionately called, will not be encumbered by bureaucracy. It also gives her an opportunity to go after the stories that she wants without worrying about stepping on anyone s toes. Pindula/Showbiz Reporter.
