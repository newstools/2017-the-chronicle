Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) in conjunction with the Matabeleland Rugby Football Board (MRFB) will hold a three-day International Rugby Level One coaching course, which starts today and ends on Saturday at Hartsfield Ground. The programme, targeting grassroots trainers and sports journalists, will see regional development officer for Eastern and Southern Africa Johnbosco Muamba and Denver Wannies from Rugby Africa and World Rugby overseeing the proceedings to ensure a quality assurance on the course.Muamba and Wannies are trainers experienced in match officiating, coaching, training, education and development. They have also conducted similar coaching courses in countries that include Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Rwanda, Burundi, Ghana, Nigeria, Swaziland, Malawi and Lesotho.Programme facilitator, ZRU national women s development manager Reuben Kumpasa, said they have so far received positive responses from those interested in taking part in the programme. I think everything is on course and through the media we have managed to receive a lot of responses from interested people. So far we have 15 journalists from different media houses and a couple of school teachers confirming their attendance. The Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) Sports Science Department will also be joining us in this programme. This is a very important move taken by the MRFB, especially to sports journalists, so that they have a better understanding of the sport. This course will equip them with necessary knowledge to be able to analyse and report on rugby, said Kumpasa.He said the first two days of the course will focus on the basics of rugby, while on Saturday participants will be taught match officiating.- @khumzallen.
