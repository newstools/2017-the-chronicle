One of the 19 Zimbabwe Golf Association order of merit events, the Dugmore Trophy, which has over the years brought together more than 100 amateur golfers at its traditional course, the Bulawayo Golf Club, was initially slated for January 20-23. It was, however, postponed due to the rains, with the organisers hoping the skies brighten up after a few days.It has not been the case as the rains have continued pounding the country, with the Meteorological Services Department on Wednesday predicting more rains and thunderstorms throughout the country in the next 10 days.Bulawayo Golf Club captain Kantilal Lalla had told Chronicle Sport then that he was hoping the tournament would be held in early March, but weather forecasts show it may not be the case.The wet weather conditions, said Matabeleland Golf Society president Victor Suerga, has forced them to postpone golf events indefinitely, including the Dugmore Trophy. The rains are rendering conditions unplayable and we have now postponed the trophy indefinitely. We will advise of the new dates, said Suerga.The Matabeleland Ladies Championship was also postponed last week for the same reason.The postponement of major golf events raises alarm with the golfing community, as some of the events are qualifying tournaments for the Windhoek Open tournament later this year. Schools golf has also not been spared.@skhumoyo2000
