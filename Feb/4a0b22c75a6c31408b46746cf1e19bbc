The left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu also contributed handsomely, with figures of 3 for 13.Pakistan began solidly in their chase, with Nahida Khan and Nain Abidi adding 40 for the first wicket. There was a brief flutter thereafter, as four wickets fell, all to the medium-pacer Kirstie Gordon, for the addition of only 15 runs, but Javeria Khan (35*) and Rabiya Shah (16*) stemmed the collapse and steered Pakistan home with an unbroken stand of 39 for the fifth wicket.South Africa were similarly ruthless in their game at the Nondescripts Cricket Club ground, bowling Papua New Guinea out for 76 on their way to a 10-wicket win. Medium-pacer Shabnim Ismail, offspinner Yolani Fourie and legspinner Sun Luus picked up two wickets each as PNG, having chosen to bat, lasted only 32.4 overs, with only Brenda Tau (30) and Pauke Siaka (17) making double-digit scores.Openers Laura Wolvaardt (43*) and Lara Goodall (28*) took care of the chase all by themselves, completing it in 13.5 overs.Chamari Polgampola s all-round performance set up Sri Lanka s comfortable seven-wicket win over Thailand, helping them finish second in Group A and securing a place in the Super Six alongside India and Ireland.Polgampola, who took 1 for 24 in Thailand s innings, steered Sri Lanka s chase of 123 with 49 off 94 balls.
