Brian Mujati in action for Sale SharksOSPREYS have signed former South Africa prop Brian Mujati until the end of the season, the Welsh Celtic League outfit announced on Sunday. The 32-year-old tighthead signs from English Premiership side Sale and has also played for Northampton.He will provide cover for injured pair Dmitri Arhip and Ma afu Fia, as well as Rhodri Jones, who is currently on Six Nations duty with Wales. This is an important signing for us given the injury situation with Dmitri and Ma afu, said Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy. Our performances this season have put us in a really strong position, but we still have eight PRO12 games to go and a Challenge Cup quarter-final (against Stade Francais) in April. Brian has proven quality at the top level and will add so much experience to the squad, particularly over the coming weeks when we are missing our international players and carrying so many injuries. Born in Zimbabwe, Mujati made 12 appearances for South Africa in 2008. Sport24.co.za.
