Mandla Lulu MpofuLovemore Zigara in Gweru UNDER-20 national coach Mandla Lulu Mpofu is yet to commit himself to Premiership returnees Shabanie Mine. Mpofu beat former Ziscosteel coach Godfrey Tamirepi to the job to replace Tendai Chikuni who joined Chapungu United early this year.The non-commitment of Mpofu saw trials that had been scheduled for Saturday being postponed to today, as both parties tried to thrash out some outstanding issues.Sources close to the Shabanie Mine camp said Mpofu was given a house by the club and was also allowed to bring an assistant as part of the deal by the asbestos miners to lure him to Zvishavane. Shabanie Mine will second another assistant coach and other backroom staff.While Mpofu could not be reached for comment as he was not answering his mobile phone, Shabanie Mine chairman Elias Marufu was evasive over the issue. I cannot talk about that at the moment, but we will issue a statement soon. However, I can assure you that trials will go on tomorrow (today) and will start at 2.45pm at Maglas Stadium where our coach Mandla Mpofu will be in charge of the exercise, said Marufu.The impasse between Shabanie Mine and Mpofu inconvenienced many players that thronged Maglas Stadium on Saturday hoping to make the cut and play for the Chinda Boys in the Premiership.Among the players already in Zvishavane for the trials are Benjamin Mukondo, Tafadzwa Chimoio, Alois Takwara and Nichson Konde who did duty for the asbestos miners during their campaign last season in Division One.The Shabanie Mine executive had said they appointed Mpofu for his experience in working with community clubs.Mpofu has previously worked as an assistant coach at Bulawayo giants Highlanders, a community team.@lavuzigara1
