Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls VICTORIA Falls first radio station-Breeze FM went live on Friday morning bringing an end to the anxiety of the resort town s residents. The station, owned by Fairtalk Communications, which also operates Skyz Metro in Bulawayo, is available on 91.2 FM.It covers a transmission radius of 40km and the locals including surrounding communities can now enjoy local programmes as opposed to foreign broacasting from Zambia and Botswana they have been subjected to over the years.Breeze FM station manager Mgcini Moyo said they went live after getting clearance from Government to access security base stations in the area. Our technicians were cleared by TelOne to access Chisuma Base Station and Chidobe Transmission site because the base stations are situated in security zones. After that we went live today, an elated Moyo said.He said since all the hiccups had been cleared, the broacasting was now permanent. We are available on 91.2 FM and on live streaming via shout cast server using the link www.listen.shoutcast .com/BreezeFM, said Moyo.He said Breeze FM s stance is to promote local talent and develop Victoria Falls. We reiterate our commitment to broadcast content that is developmental, family oriented, entertaining and promotes the cultures and artistic talent in the Zambezi Valley, said Moyo.He said the radio station s musical show will promote local artists and its talk shows will be interactive in order to give the people of Victoria Falls a voice on issues relating to their day to day lives.Moyo said the station s flagship talk show is Zwakala Falls, a Monday programme which interacts with residents on issues affecting them.There are about 20 current affairs presenters and newsreaders in all beats such as sport and entertainment.The station will broadcast in English and in local languages such as Nambya, Tonga and Ndebele.Local artists are on cloud nine as they believe they now have a station that will give them a platform to showcase their different talents.Sithabile Lulu Dambo who manages the resort town s men of the moment Godwin Ras Boom Ngwenya and Joseph DJ Ace Kater Mpofu of Izankaleli fame welcomed the station. This is a great step because at least now people would have access to our music live and vote for it. This also puts away the issue of pre-recorded shows that we have been living on where people wouldn t have access to us as musicians but listen to old interviews, she said.@ncubeleon
