Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council has warned residents who refuse to open weep holes in their pre-cast walls that they are contributing to flash floods in some suburbs. Councillors say they have been called to resolve squabbles in some areas where residents refused to open the weep holes to ensure that water flows out of yards.Last month, more than 20 houses were affected by flash floods in Nketa 8 suburb, leaving occupants knee deep in water due to poor drainage.The drainage systems were clogged with sand and dirt.Speaking during a full council meeting on Wednesday, councillors expressed disappointment that some residents flout a standing by-law by blocking weep holes.Ward 23 Clr Thobane Ncube raised the motion saying council must be clear on what it is doing to ensure that no-one violates the by-law. Let us be clear on attempts that we are doing in terms of resolving conflicts that we get used as a result of some people s durawalls blocking water, said Clr Ncube.Ward 24 Clr Gideon Mangena said he had been called to solve such issues and had decided to take stern measures against those refusing to comply. Some residents refuse to open weep holes so I have taken a stance that those who refuse to comply, I just call the Fire Brigade and they will do the job.After that, the resident has to pay for their services including the labour because we can t be tolerating people who don t want to comply causing other people to suffer in the act, he said.Clr Mangena said when constructing durawalls, people must be told of the importance of weep holes.Ward 29 Clr Lillian Mlilo-Lubimbi said residents who refuse to comply with the by-law must be reported to council so that council takes action. I have told residents in my area that they must report troublesome neighbours to the Housing Office so that council takes action. No one must suffer because of the rains, water must flow out of yards, she said.Clr Silas Chigora weighed in saying those who refuse to comply must be reported to council. As council we passed a by-law on weep holes so if people have problems with their neighbours they must report to council and they come to inspect and force them to do the right thing, he said. @Auxiliak&nbsp;
