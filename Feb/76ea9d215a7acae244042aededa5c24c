Zvenyika Makonese in Orlando Pirates coloursLovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Zimbabwe international defender Zvenyika Makonese has accused Swaziland Premiership side Manzini Wanderers of unprofessionalism following his failed bid to join the club. The Shabanie Mine defender blamed the Swazi club for shifting goalposts regarding their initial agreement.He had reportedly signed for Wanderers last year, but a sudden turn of events saw him leaving the club in a huff without signing a contract.Makonese, who helped the Chinda Boys return to the PSL after a three-year absence, said the Swazi club failed to meet its side of the bargain as far as his welfare was concerned. I left Manzini Wanderers because they failed to honour what we had agreed on. They wanted to give me a paltry salary of R4 000 and a signing on fee of R5 000, figures which were way below what we had agreed on. We had also agreed that they would provide me with a house and a car, but they were no longer willing to honour those obligations so I left. I am an international player and I cannot be treated that way, said Makonese.He, however, would not reveal his next move, but chances are that he could return to Shabanie Mine.There was speculation that Makonese was left out in the cold after Julius Chakupewa, who had been appointed Manzini Wanderers coach, was relieved of his duties for not possessing a Caf B Licence, the minimum qualification for one to coach in the Swazi Premiership.Chakupewa, who has since been appointed Ivan Hoe coach in the Zifa Central Soccer League, was instrumental in courting Makonese to Swaziland.@lavuzigara1
