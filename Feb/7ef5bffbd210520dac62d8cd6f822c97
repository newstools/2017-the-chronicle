Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange THE new Hwange Pool Association League (HPAL) is scheduled to kick-off in the second week of next month. Matabeleland North Provincial Pool Association president Humphrey Riyano confirmed that registration of players was underway and the deadline was on March 4. It is a new and exciting era for pool in Hwange as registration is on. The league will commence a week later with a teams gala at Ingagula Bar. Confirmed league participants are GK Snipers, Ko Mpofu Pool Club, GVZ Pool Club, Ingagula Pool Club, Ralyton Pool Club and ZRP Hwange, although other clubs are finalising the registration process. We expect at least eight teams in the league, said Riyano. What really inspired the creation of this league was the experience I had in the professional pool circles in Mutare back in 2014, so I started imparting knowledge to others, which then inspired us to have the idea of forming our own professional league.The vision for pool development is not for Hwange only, but the province at large, hence the creation of provincial pool structures. Work is in progress to have Binga and Lupane leagues as there is enormous untapped talent craving for exposure in this game. Clubs affiliation fees are pegged at $100.Zimbabwe Pool Association president Godknows Maravanyika also confirmed Hwange s new status. We are pleased to welcome Hwange as an affiliate of our national set-up. It clearly demonstrates the growth of the sport in the country as a whole. The exposure to be gained through participating in national tournaments will help players develop their skills, said Maravanyika.Other members of the Riyano-led committee are Precious Mpofu (vice-president), Tavengwa Mandira (secretary-general), Lameck Kachere (deputy secretary-general), Witness Lunga (treasurer), Edgar Mugota (marketing and publicity), Kennedy Chiwanza (development), Wellington Chiweshe (referees coordinator) and Itai Dube (women in pool representative).@tobymandox
