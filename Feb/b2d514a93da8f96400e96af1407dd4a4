We are looking at the next game. Orlando Pirates is the next game, Mosimane said. We don t have him (Arendse) against Orlando Pirates, but look we got Thabo Nthethe, we got Bangaly (Soumahoro) who can come in and slot in there. Look, hectic, hectic programme, that s why we rested Khama also, we took him out. That&#8217;s why we kept Mabunda, he s also on a yellow and Kekana is on a yellow, so at least I must have one for Saturday,&#8221; he added. One needs the three points. Sometimes we like to score five or four, but we just need the three points. So let&#8217;s go step by step, one goal at a time and don&#8217;t look at the top.&#8221;Meanwhile, Pirates woes continued when they were held to a goalless stalemate by Platinum Stars away in a league game which was played in midweek.This draw extended the Soweto giants winless run to five matches in the league.

They are just a point behind eighth-placed Golden Arrows.Tendai Ndoro, the Pirates striker and current league top goalscorer, hasn&#8217;t scored in three games. Bucs will be hoping that he rediscovers his scoring form against Sundowns.Pirates caretaker coach Augusto Palacios has discussed his side s title aspirations ahead of their highly anticipated clash with Sundowns. We are playing Sundowns over the weekend. We need to work on the scoring and finishing our chances, Palacios said. You know, let me tell you something in football. You cannot predict but you can think mathematically.&#8220;Nineteen points and 28 points, you are talking about nine points. You think about one game in hand,&#8221; he continued.&#8220;You may never never know, sometimes you win two games in succession and you are in a different position,&#8221; he added.&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope. We need to continue to work hard. You say nine points is too far but you need to continue to fight.&#8221;The last time Sundowns and Pirates met in a league game was 12 months ago.
