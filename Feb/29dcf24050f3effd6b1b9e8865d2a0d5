Youths at the party on SaturdayBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent IN the confinement of a bus the stomping of feet, gyrating waists, whistling in excitement and dripping sweat was a hot box of an electrifying atmosphere as Zanu-PF youths geared up for Bob @ 93 celebrations. The Kongonya dance was the signature move for youths in one of the many buses that made a beeline to the Bob @ 93 birthday celebrations at the Rhodes Estate Preparatory School in Matobo district on Saturday.Chronicle Showbiz boarded one bus which had stopped just after Cresta hotel along Matopos road, as they picked up more comrades to the biggest party this side of the country.As soon as the crew entered, the youths were in high spirits singing Nyatso Terera by Mbare Chimurenga group, cheering and whistling with clenched fists in the air.Without the help of drums or clappers they were using their voices, feet and hands to sing and dance on their way to the party. In between the songs there were chants of Pamberi navaMugabe, President Mugabe hoyeeee and other various praise chants.The 33KM journey became too short for the youths as they were relentless in their singing and dancing with the Kongonya being the most popular. The limited space that a bus has did not deter them from finding space to gyrate up and down the aisle or where they were seated.As we got to the venue, the atmosphere got to fever pitch as the youths disembarked and joined the thousands that had gathered at the venue.At the venue Sandra Ndebele, Khuliyo, Jeys Marabini, Black Umfolosi, Ben Arinoti, Tholakele and Sulumani Chimbetu were the pick of the entertainers as they rocked the crowd. Disappointingly Derrick Majaivana nearly embarrassed himself as he was uncoordinated at a crucial moment.President Mugabe and the First Family were about to cut the cake but at that moment he decided to sing a rendition of his father s track Umoya Wami . Even Zanu-PF secretary of the youth Kudzanayi Chipanga, who was presiding over the cutting of the cake, called for him to change songs. Saving the day and after a brief moment of silence, Sulumani Chimbetu with the help of the police band, sang happy birthday to Zimbabwe s first citizen.After the speeches and other pleasantries such as the cutting of the cake by the First family, some delegates went to eat while others headed back to Bulawayo.There was congestion at the intersection of Robert Mugabe Way and 10th Avenue on Saturday.The nightspots recorded a high number of patrons with Club Connect, Eden, BAC, Club 263, Private Lounge and Legends Sports Diner packed to the rafters. Club 263 reportedly shutdown at 6.30AM yesterday.
