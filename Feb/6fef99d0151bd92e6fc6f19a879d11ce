Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent PART of a mountain disintegrated in Gumela area of Matobo District in Matabeleland South on Monday morning in what villagers described as a landslide. This becomes the second such incident to be reported in Matabeleland South following another one which occurred in Filabusi last week following heavy rains.Mrs Simangali Maphenduka of Safari Paradise Farm said part of a mountain in her farm came down in a frightening experience at around 6AM.She said the incident sent birds and livestock scurrying for cover. It was shocking. I was doing my morning prayers before I heard three loud noises coming from the mountain. I was perplexed. Shortly I saw part of the mountain coming down destroying nearby trees, said Mrs Maphenduka.She said at first she and other villagers thought it was something exploding. We are all shocked about the incident. This can only be God communicating with us, said Mrs Maphenduka.Her husband Mr Elliot Maphenduka who visited The Chronicle news room said his wish was to see geological experts visiting the area. I wasn t at home but when my wife phoned me about the incident, I became concerned. The mountain is just about 50 metres from my house. I even suspected that it could have been an earthquake. But on second thoughts I wondered why it would occur on the mountain only, he said.Last week, another landslide occurred in Filabusi.@nqotshili
