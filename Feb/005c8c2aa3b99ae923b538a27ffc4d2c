Sports Reporter Headquarters 1 Infantry Brigade inter-units sports competitions kicked off at Induna Barracks on Wednesday. The tournament, sponsored by Golden Knot Legal Aid Society, ends today.Four teams, which include Headquarters Total 1 Infantry and its integral units 1.1 Combat Group, 1.2 Infantry Battalion and 1.3 Reserve Force Battalion, faced-off in soccer, netball and volleyball. HQ 1 Infantry Brigade public relations officer Lieutenant Brian Muchero said the competitions were making a return after a long time. These games have always been there and they are meant to be conducted annually. However, due to some challenges and other commitments, we were forced to take a break. There are lots of prizes to be won and the best teams will walk away with trophies, team jerseys and prize money, said Muchero. The first day was a huge success with a lot of exciting, competitive games being played. We hope it will get even more competitive as we get closer to the final day. Through this tournament, we are trying to build teams that will represent us, he said. @khumzallen.
