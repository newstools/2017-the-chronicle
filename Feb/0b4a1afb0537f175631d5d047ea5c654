Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) board chairman, Mr Basil Nyabadza, said the fall army worm was reported two weeks ago and efforts were underway to contain it. An outbreak of the fall army worm has been reported at Arda Ingwizi Estate. The situation seems to be serious as the pest has moved from the leaves and is now eating up the cobs. I m yet to go onto the ground to assess the level of damage but efforts are underway to contain the situation as we have started spraying pesticide to ensure that our projected yield isn t affected, said Mr Nyabadza.A Matabeleland South provincial and Mangwe District Command Agriculture team visited the Estate on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by the fall army worm.Speaking during the visit, Arda Ingwizi Estate Manager, Mr Samuel Nyajeka, said the maize stalk borer was also attacking the crops.He said since they started spraying two weeks ago, there has been a decrease in the number of worms per cob. We have started spraying pesticides using the aeroplane spray method so that we can cover much ground. Crops with maize at the milk dough stage are being attacked by the fall army worm and the maize stalk borer, Mr Nyajeka said.He said efforts were underway to ensure that the pest does not spread throughout the estate.Crops in Matabeleland North, Bulawayo, Midlands and Manicaland provinces have been affected by the fall army worm.In Matabeleland North, the pest was first seen at Moza Irrigation Scheme in Bulilima District.Moza Irrigation Scheme Chairperson, Mrs Esnathi Ngwenya, said the worm had affected most of the maize crop within the scheme.Bulilima Farmers Association Chairperson, Mr Obert Sibanda, recently appealed to Government to assist farmers in containing the spread of the pest. He said most small scale farmers did not have the capacity to buy pesticides.Government said it had started distributing Carbaryl 85 Wettable Powder across the country to control the outbreak of the fall army worm.Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development, Department of Plant Protection and Research Institute Chief Entomologist, Dr Godfrey Chikwenhere, said the pest had 12 cycles and could continue recurring after the first spray.
