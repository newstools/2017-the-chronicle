Everything is now in place and the event officials have been sorted. We are still receiving some calls from various clubs confirming their participation so we are expecting a huge turn-out. This event is mainly aiming at developing talent as well as exposing some talents to big competitions. Athletes need to be at their feet at all times and if they sit down they might become rusty so through this event, the association is aiming at keeping the athletes on that competitive mood, said Ncube.She also said the competition is aiming at preparing athletes for the regional cross country, JM Busha track and field championships and CBC half marathon races. @khumzallen
