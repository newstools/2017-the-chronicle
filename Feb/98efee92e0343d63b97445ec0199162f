THE Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) says it requires financial support to assist small to medium enterprises (SMEs) attain world recognised certification for their systems and products to allow them to penetrate international markets. Described as the new economy, SMEs have in the last few years become the major driver of Zimbabwe s economy due to the dearth of the formal economy.While many remain informal, making it difficult for Government to tax them, small enterprises are employing the biggest chunk of Zimbabwe s economically active age groups while also producing goods for both local and at times export markets.Experts have however noted that the same small companies are not aware of their huge export potential while some were struggling to get their goods out of the country as their product quality failed to meet international standards.SAZ acting director general Cyril Siringwani told journalists that the body was willing to help SMEs upgrade their systems and products quality. The objective is that they (SMEs) can access external markets using standards and systems recognised in the world, Siringwani said. The interest from SMEs to get certification is huge and there is still potential subject to support. The SAZ boss said support from well-wishers would enable the standards body to roll out training programmes for SMEs across the country.Last year SAZ, which is a non-governmental organisation but recognised by Government as the national standards body, received funding from the European Union that allowed the institution to hold training sessions for small businesses in the country s 10 provinces.The EU, Siringwani said, was keen to have more Zimbabwean companies exporting to that market.The European bloc last year funded the setting up of a new laboratory for the standards body.Siringwani said getting certification meant company products were not only of high quality but were safe for consumption.Despite certification being voluntary, he said, the number of companies getting accredited was going up. As SAZ we are continuously preaching the gospel that you must be certified but we have also been facing economic challenges in the country and some organisations are closing and that has been affecting the number of certifications, Siringwani said. But when you look at our numbers, the number of companies being certified is going up. As of 2016, about 200 companies got different kinds of certifications from SAZ.The proposed setting up of a Government controlled standards regulatory body would likely see the introduction of mandatory standard accreditation for many companies and their products, he said.In 2016 the number of SAZ certified products went up to 365 from 331 the previous year.
