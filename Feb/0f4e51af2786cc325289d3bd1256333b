A lot of work has been done at our facilities and we like to thank the Ministry of Sport and Recreation for the guidance and their assistance financially.Everything is now set and all the swimming pools are in good state. There were some few leaking issues on the water polo pool but it s sorted now and all it needs is a little bit of cleaning otherwise its perfect. I have no doubt that by Monday morning we will be done with it, said Kloppers. I have had a lot of feedback from parents and swimmers and they are extremely happy to be together. We really appreciate the guidance and together we are really going to make this a memorable occasion for Zimbabwe, she said.She also said security, transport, equipment and accommodation for the guest countries has been sorted with Seychelles and Kenya expected in the country on Monday. @khumzallen/@rasmthembo
