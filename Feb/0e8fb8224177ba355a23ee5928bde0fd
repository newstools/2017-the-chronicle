Cynthia Dube, Court Reporter A Bulawayo magistrate has ordered an unemployed man who allegedly boasts of being a super dad after siring nine children with three women in three years, to pay $120 per month for the upkeep of one of his children. Mr Tinashe Tashaya heard that Kudakwashe Maregedze (35) of Harare`s Glen Norah suburb has four children with Ms Rachel Lunga, four children with Ms Jesca Rudzayi and a child with Ms Sophia Jiri.Ms Jiri (21) of Entumbane suburb dragged Maregedze to court seeking $206 for the upkeep of their six-year-old child.She said Maregedze has never contributed to the upkeep of the child.Mr Tashaya ordered him to pay $120 per month for the upkeep of his child starting from this month end. You have to deposit $120 into the applicant`s bank account. Maybe if you pay this amount you will stop impregnating women. I wish these other women can also drag you to court claiming maintenance because you are not behaving like a responsible man, he said. You have to look for a job and maintain your child. Failure to do so you are going to be arrested and we will meet in criminal court .Ms Jiri said Maregedze was irresponsible. Your Worship, l ve been struggling to maintain this child for the past six years. The child needs food, clothes and money for medication. Kudakwashe has never assisted me. He always hides when l go to Harare to look for him, she said.In response, Maregedze told the court that he could afford $10 per month as he is not working. Your Worship I have four children with Ms Rachel Lunga and four children with Ms Jesca Rudzayi and the other one with the applicant. All of these children need my support and I m not working, he said as he handed over nine birth certificates to the magistrate.@cynthiamthembo1
