Shakes MashabaBring it on! This is the dare from Safa to beleaguered former Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba ahead of today s hearing at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) hearing. Mashaba is claiming unfair dismissal after being shown the door in December.Chief executive officer Dennis Mumble told City Press on Friday that they were ready to defend their decision and prove they were right.Mumble dismissed Mashaba s efforts as a waste of time.However, Mashaba s legal representative, Claudio Bollo, said they were confident the conciliation process would work in their favour. We are hoping for an amicable solution from this process and we will take it from there, said Bollo.He said they had already approached the labour court to interdict Safa from continuing with a search for Mashaba s replacement until the CCMA has ruled on the matter. The case has been set for February 14 and we hope it will be a good Valentine s Day for us, but what happens on Tuesday will determine if we go ahead with the case or not. However, Mumble said that Safa was proceeding with the search for Mashaba s replacement.He revealed that Safa had received many unsolicited CVs. It s only this past week that I have had a chance to go through some of the CVs and I m impressed by the calibre of coaches who have shown interest in the job. Sport24.
