Matabeleland South District Criminal Investigations Officer Chief Superintendent Max MaqandiSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PLUMTREE is this year s host of the Matabeleland South District Criminal Investigations Officer s annual sports gala that brings together three districts from the province. The games started yesterday and will end today.According to the Matabeleland South District Criminal Investigations Officer Chief Superintendent Max Maqandi, officers from Gwanda, Beitbridge and hosts Plumtree will compete in netball, darts, pool, chess, volleyball and football for both men and women. Our indoor games, pool, chess and darts, will be held at the Lakings Sports Club while the rest of the games will be at the Plumtree High School grounds.We thought of taking this year s games away from Gwanda so that all our districts can play host to the event instead of always travelling, said Maqandi.He said the gala would be used to select a provincial team to represent Matabeleland South at the southern region CID Coordinator s gala set for Gwanda at the end of this month.Acting southern region CID coordinator Chief Superintendent Patrick Romeo Moyo will be the guest of honour.Officers participation in the gala is viewed by their commanders as fundamental to the overall physical, mental and spiritual development of the officers.In 2015 Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri told officers at the Commissioner General s Gala that police officers are expected to out think, outrun and ultimately overwhelm criminals in their machinations.The law enforcers games will culminate in the selection of a national squad that will represent Zimbabwe at the Southern African Police Chiefs Co-operations Organisation Games (SARPPCO).&nbsp;
