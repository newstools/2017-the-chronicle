People arriving at the scene of the blast yesterday. Al JazeeraIslamabad (Pakistan) Pakistan has closed two of its border crossings with Afghanistan and demanded that Kabul takes action against 76 terrorists it says are hiding in Afghan territory in response to the worst attack on Pakistani soil since 2014. At least 88 people were killed and hundreds more wounded when a suicide attacker targeted a gathering of worshippers at a shrine in the southern town of Sehwan on Thursday.The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group claimed responsibility for the blast.The shrine, built in 1356, is by the tomb of Syed Muhammad Usman Marwandi, the Sufi philosopher poet better known as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, one of Pakistan s most venerated saints.Yesterday, Pakistan s military said Afghanistan must take immediate action against the 76 people identified to them.Security officials told reporters that at least 39 suspected fighters had been killed in security raids carried out overnight in response to the attack.Thursday s attack came after one of the bloodiest weeks in recent memory in Pakistan, with at least 99 people killed in a series of attacks since Monday, most claimed by the Pakistani Taliban or one of its factions.On Monday, 13 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a rally in the eastern city of Lahore.That attack was followed on Wednesday by a suicide bombing at a government office in the Mohmand tribal area and a suicide attack on government employees in Peshawar, killing six people.Two police officers were killed on Tuesday while trying to defuse a bomb in the Balochistan provincial capital of Quetta.Al Jazeera s Kamal Hyder said the second major border crossing at Chaman, which leads to Kandahar in Afghanistan from the Pakistani city of Quetta, was closed on Friday after the Torkham border was sealed off late on Thursday.In Sehwan, meanwhile, police cordoned off the shrine early on Friday as forensic investigators arrived.The floor of the shrine was still stained with blood yesterday morning as dozens of protesters pushed past police pickets demanding to be allowed to continue to worship there. At least 20 children are believed to be among the dead, the head of Sehwan s medical facility, Moeen Uddin Siddiqui, said.At 3.30AM, the shrine s caretaker stood among the carnage and defiantly rang its bell, a daily ritual that he vowed to continue.The Sindh provincial government announced three days of mourning as Pakistanis vented their grief and fury on social media, bemoaning the lack of medical facilities to help the wounded, with the nearest hospital around 70km from the shrine.All shrines in the province have been closed, a decision that prompted furious reaction from protesters in Sehwan. Give us the charge of the mazaar [shrine], we will take care of it rather than the police, a shopkeeper said. Keeping it closed is unfair to the people of Sehwan. We can take care of our own place. We can do everything to protect it. AFP
