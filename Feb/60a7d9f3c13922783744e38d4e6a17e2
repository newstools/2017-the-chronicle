Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange ZIFA Southern Region Division One league side ZPC Hwange are aiming for the title this season and plan to raid the market in a spending spree to bolster their squad for the assault. The electricity generators have ended the past two seasons in fourth position despite starting on a promising note on both occasions.ZPC Hwange secretary-general Mehluli Thebe said his team would go for the jugular this season to secure a berth in the Premiership in 2018. We have sat as an executive and agreed that we can t remain stagnant as it is not good for football development and not in the interests of the community that supports us, said Thebe. We are scouring the market countrywide searching for quality players to reinforce the team. I am not taking anything away from the current crop of players who are good in my eyes, but it is obvious that as we revise our targets upwards, the introduction of new personnel is inevitable. He said coach Njabulo Dube, who joined the team in 2012, will remain at the helm of the technical set up. The technical bench remains the same as we have faith in them. We need to play our part as the executive on the resources provision angle and success will follow, Thebe said.Dube promised to repay the faith the team s hierarchy has shown in him and his lieutenants. We have to work extra hard and do bette than last season. I have an obligation to please my paymasters and the supporters who are clamouring for Premier Soccer League status, said Dube. We also have to be mentally strong if we are to achieve that feat. I am also happy that I can get new players to strengthen my squad this year. It s all systems go from next Tuesday when we begin trials for the big fight ahead, said Dube who will be assisted by Brighton Siziba. @obymandox
