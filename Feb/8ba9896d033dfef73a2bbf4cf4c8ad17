At first, we were supposed to have one album launch in Bulawayo in March, but because of demand from fans in South Africa, we decided to go all out and also have a big show there, said Nyoni. This is our first major show in Bulawayo and we urge people to come in their numbers. Nyoni said after the album launch in South Africa, the latest offering would be released and will be available in various stores which they are still finalising the deal with. We re identifying record bars and outlets where the album will be available. Also we re still ironing out how much we re going to charge each copy of the album s CD, said Nyoni.&nbsp;
