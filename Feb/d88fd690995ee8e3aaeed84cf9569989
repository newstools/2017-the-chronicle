According to a list published by South African football publication Soccer Laduma, Ndlovu is among a host of stars, notably Africa s only Fifa World Player of the Year George Weah of Liberia, who could not lift Africa s biggest trophy.Other African legends in that category are Didier Drogba (Cote d Ivoire), Kalusha Bwalya (Zambia), the Nigerian duo of Nwanko Kanu and Jay Jay Okocha, Ghana greats Abedi Pele, Michael Essien, Anthony Yeboah and Asamoah Gyan, as well as South African Benni McCarthy.One of the most outstanding footballers to ever emerge from Zimbabwe, Ndlovu was part of the star studded Dream Team coached by the late Reinhard Fabisch and only made history by qualifying Zimbabwe for their first ever Afcon appearance in 2004.With a record of 100 caps for the Warriors, Nsukuzonke, as Ndlovu was fondly known during his playing days, is the all-time leading goal scorer for the Warriors with 38 goals.He was the first African player to move from Africa to the English Premiership after signing for Coventry City in 1991.Now about 250 African players have played in the English Premiership since 1992.Ndlovu left Highlanders to join Coventry where he scored 41 goals in 179 appearances.In 1997, Ndlovu signed for Birmingham City and helped them to two successive play-off semi-finals in the Nationwide Division One. He later joined Sheffield United in 2001 where he made 135 appearances.Ndlovu then spent four years at South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns before joining Thanda Royal Zulu where he eventually retired.After his retirement in 2009, Ndlovu returned to football as coach of the Zimbabwe Under-23 squad and Warriors assistant coach.He rejoined Sundowns in 2013 as team manager. @khumzallen
