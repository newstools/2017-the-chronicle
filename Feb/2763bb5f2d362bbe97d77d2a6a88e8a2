Mandla ManyathelaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter TSHOLOTSHO Football Club s preparations are moving in the right direction with the side set to boost its midfield department with the arrival of Chicken Inn midfielder Canaan Nkomo. Iziqholo zeZhwane, who parted ways with long serving coach Lizwe Sweswe after he joined cash rich FC Platinum, are being taken through the pre-season preparations by former Mighty Warriors coach Shadreck Mlauzi who has been taken on board in the absence of Farai Tawachera who is attending a Caf A licence course in Harare and is tipped to take over from Sweswe. The team is taking shape, it has to actually, said club president Mandla Manyathela in an interview last week.Manyathela could not be drawn into revealing names of new players trying their luck in the squad, preferring however to say there are new faces eager to join. He also could not deny nor confirm that Highlanders have released a number of their Division One players to his team. The squad is thick as I speak, I think we have about 40 players and the number has to go down. The coming of Highlanders players is something I am hearing from you, if they are there maybe they came on their own and could be part of the guys on trials not that there was any special arrangement for them to come, he said.Revered Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo, who has been quietly going about his preparations for the yet to be branded Premier Soccer League, confirmed that Nkomo has since been released to Tsholotsho. Canaan has been released to Tsholotsho, Gumbo said.Tsholotsho will start preparatory friendly matches next month as part of their final lap in preparations ahead of the final registration of their players for the season which the Premier Soccer League said was March 31. Our final deadline for submission of player registration is March 31, I will have to check with the office if any of the teams have submitted their names ahead of the initial registration deadline of February 28, said Premier Soccer League chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele.
