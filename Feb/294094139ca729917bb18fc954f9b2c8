The company began operating in 1989 and is a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe (IDCZ).The firm has been facing operational challenges, which have seen the staff complement falling to less than 20 from more than 200 over the years.Sometimes employees get paid in form of bricks because of lack of low revenues.Dete Industrial Ceramics board chairman Mr Brian Mushohwe visited Dete to meet the community on Friday following eviction of the company s general manager Mr Godfrey Zivanai recently. The issue of Last Hope Estate was put to Cabinet, which is seized with the matter at the moment to try and see what can be done. Cabinet is aware of the community s concerns to be involved in production. The feeling is that it is Ok to surrender it to the community but there is a procedure to be followed since you will now be like investors. We are working on the process of how the whole thing can be done as we look at people forming a trust, said Mr Mushohwe.He said the community of Dete will be expected to write a proposal to the IDCZ in respect of assets of the company. The Government s position is to empower the community but there should be a procedure. I was sent by the board to hear your concerns that if you want to participate that can be done, said Mr Mushohwe.He was responding to calls by the community, which evicted Mr Zivanai on allegations of wearing down the parastatal and abusing workers and the community.The firm, which makes bricks and clay products such as tiles, is currently closed following the eviction of Mr Zivanai.IDCZ s properties in Dete are managed under the name Last Hope Estate and include the New Game Reserve Hotel, a bakery that has been turned into a vending market, a fuel service station, which is now closed, a restaurant also closed and a farm, which Lupane State University used to rent but moved out because of high rentals.There was also Detema Safari Lodge, which was gutted by fire a few years ago.@ncubeleon
