Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Hwange striker Newman Sianchali is set for a loan move to Premiership returnees Bantu Rovers for the 2017 season. The vastly gifted player, who was released by the coal miners towards the end of last season, will be loaned out to Rovers by ambitious Zifa Southern Region Division One side Talen Vision, who quietly snapped him up on a two-year renewable contract early this year.Talen Vision manager and renowned high jumper Juma Phiri confirmed Sianchali s imminent loan move and dispelled social media reports that Rovers had signed the player for a paltry $200. Sianchali remains our player as Talen Vision, but we gave him to Bantu Rovers so that they can assess him and if he impresses we will definitely loan him to them. I reiterate that the deal will not be involving any monetary issues, but will be out of the ubuntu culture. This is just a good gesture to a fellow Southern Region club as we believe in neighbourliness. No money is involved here, said the Zimbabwe national high jump record holder, who is also a qualified sports administrator.Rovers general manager Wilbert Sibanda confirmed the presence of Sianchali at their training sessions, but said nothing had materialised yet. Yes, he is training with us, but is yet to be registered if he impresses our coaches, said Sibanda.Sources close to the deal, however, said it was a done deal.Sianchali had initially expressed interest in joining Highlanders, but a member of the Bulawayo giants technical department allegedly said the player was now outside the sale buy date due to age. He is 29.Rovers said they wanted an experienced striker to lead their teething strikeforce in the Premiership.@skhumoyo2000
