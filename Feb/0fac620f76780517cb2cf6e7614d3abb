Walter Mswazie recently in Chivi RURAL schools should have classes for skills development and vocational training so that pupils can be groomed into manufacturers not job seekers, a Cabinet Minister has said. Addressing staff and pupils at the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe (RCZ) run Chibi High School in Chivi District during the official handover ceremony of text books, chairs and some food stuffs donated by Chibi Old Students Association (CHOSA) on Friday, the Minister of State for Liaising on Psychomotor Activities in Education, Cde Josiah Hungwe, said the need for equipping pupils in rural areas with relevant skills cannot be overemphasised.He said the economic situation in the country calls for youths with relevant skills which can help them create employment.The Minister, who is also a former student at the school as well as Chivi and Mwenezi Senator, challenged former students of schools around the country to give back to the community through developing their former schools. As a Minister responsible for the promotion of skills and vocational training in education, I want Chibi High to establish classes for vocational training. I am there to assist you and I challenge CHOSA to start the ball rolling as soon as possible, I will support you. We thank CHOSA for making a kind gesture of donating to this school as part of ploughing back to the community, said Cde Hungwe.He said Government wants all schools to be actively involved in vocational training and skills development as a way of addressing the skills gap in the country.Cde Hungwe said some rural schools are supposed to be developed into colleges and universities to help in the development of rural areas.The Minister said Chibi High can be turned into a vocational and skills training college which can be developed into a university.He said Chibi High School has managed to produce leading luminaries and Cabinet Ministers that include: Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) regional director Professor Raphinos Chabaya, Reformed Church University (RCU) Vice Chancellor Professor Wiseman Magwa; High Court assessor Mr Poster Dauramanzi; late Cabinet Minister Cde Witness Mangwende, former Minister of Energy and Power Development Mr Dzikamai Mavhaire, former Masvingo Governor Cde Willard Chiwewe as well as Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Cde Shuvai Mahofa, among others. We want all pupils to be involved in vocational and skills training so that they are equipped with relevant skills. We have changed our focus now as government as we look beyond job seeking. My Ministry s thrust is to have school pupils who are equipped with relevant skills. We have to address the skills gap in the country, Cde Hungwe said. @walterbmswazie2
