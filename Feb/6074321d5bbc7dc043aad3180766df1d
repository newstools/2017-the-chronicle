Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls NEWLY appointed Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) board member Clement Mukwasi has resigned as Amagagasi FC s legal advisor. Mukwasi was named in the new SRC board led by Edward Siwela and appointed by Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane recently.He tendered his resignation from the Zifa Southern Region Division One club on Tuesday in terms of the SRC regulations, which compel board members not to be part of any national sports association or club.Mukwasi, the public relations manager at Shearwater Adventures, said he was emotional about leaving the club, which he had been a part of since its formation in 2014. I am fulfilling this legal mandate and my parting words will be that as a club you have to adhere to good corporate governance and follow a structured constitution, which should provide for tenure of office, elections, financial management and AGMs, said Mukwasi, while addressing a club meeting on Tuesday.He implored the Victoria Falls-based club to follow government policy in procurement of material and even players as well as to invest in the community by promoting junior policy and talent identification.Mukwasi challenged the club leadership to pursue the idea of engaging the Victoria Falls Municipality towards acquiring land to build a stadium and to widen its scope by venturing into other businesses for sustainability.Victoria Falls-based lawyer Givemore Mvhiringi of Mvhiringi and Associates takes over as Amagagasi s new legal advisor, according to club chairman Bekithemba Mlotshwa. We accept his resignation and are proud as a club that he was appointed from our books. We hope that being at national level will help us as a town and region in terms of our cause as clubs and associations. We have another lawyer Mvhiringi replacing him and he has already started working on the (club) s constitution, Mlotshwa said.@ncubeleon.
