ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC sealed the first major silverware of Jose Mourinho s Manchester United reign and broke Southampton s hearts as the Swedish star s late goal clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory in yesterday s League Cup final. Ibrahimovic was one of Mourinho s marquee signings in the close-season and he repaid his manager s faith with a typically dominant display on the big occasion at Wembley.The 35-year-old opened the scoring with a blistering free-kick before Jesse Lingard doubled United s lead.Manolo Gabbiadini sparked a thrilling Southampton fightback, scoring just before half-time and again early in the second half.But Ibrahimovic had the last word as his 87th minute header his 26th goal of the campaign ensured Mourinho joined United legend Alex Ferguson and Nottingham Forest great Brian Clough as the only managers to win the League Cup four times.Mourinho is the first United manager to win a top prize in his maiden season at Old Trafford, a feat not even Ferguson or Matt Busby achieved.It was also the 54-year-old s 19th major trophy of his glittering career.With United trailing well behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, Mourinho needed this success to guarantee players, fans and the club s hierarchy remain in his corner.But the serial winner will hope the victory acts as a catalyst to claim bigger prizes in the near future, just as it did when the League Cup was the first silverware of his maiden spell with Chelsea.It is 41 years since Southampton shocked United in the FA Cup final to lift the only major trophy in the club s history and Claude Puel s team deserve credit for an enterprising display that took them agonisingly close to another huge upset.In the absence of injured playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan and with Wayne Rooney again on the bench, the stage was set for Ibrahimovic to cement his status as United s talisman and he wasted little time stamping his authority on his first showpiece occasion in England.Demanding the ball right from the start, Ibrahimovic s astute pass set up France midfielder Paul Pogba for a fierce long-range effort that stung the palms of Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster.Southampton responded with a dangerous raid that should have brought the opening goal in the 11th minute when Cedric Soares crossed low into the six yard box and Gabbiadini side-footed past David de Gea., only to see his celebrations curtailed by a dubious offside decision.Emboldened by that lucky escape, United swept forward and in the 19th minute Oriol Romeu made a costly error when he try to halt another attack with a crude lunge on Ander Herrera.Romeu was booked but there was worse punishment to come from the free-kick as Ibrahimovic stepped up to smash his dipping shot over the Southampton wall.Despite their lead, United still looked alarmingly casual and De Gea was forced to save from James Ward-Prowse and Dusan Tadic.But Southampton were even more negligent at the back and Mourinho s men made them pay again in the 38th minute.Marcos Rojo was given room to pick out Lingard inside the penalty area and the United forward couldn t believe this luck as the statuesque Saints defence allowed him to guide a low finish past Forster.Yet on the stroke of half-time Southampton were back in it as United were caught napping by Ward-Prowse s cross and Gabbiadini applied the finishing touch with a cool close-range effort.With the strangely diffident Pogba offering little protection to United s defence, Southampton exposed United s defensive flaws again to draw level in the 48th minute.When a corner was directed back into the United area, Pogba missed a header and Gabbiadini reacted quicker than Chris Smalling to whip his shot past De Gea for his fifth goal in just three appearances since a January move from Napoli.Romeu almost won it when he headed against a post from Ward-Prowse s corner.But, despite a far from convincing display from United, it was Ibrahimovic who delivered the knockout blow with extra-time looming.He started and finished a United counter, ghosting into the six-yard box to meet Herrera s cross with a bullet header that added more lustre to both United and Mourinho s trophy cabinets.
