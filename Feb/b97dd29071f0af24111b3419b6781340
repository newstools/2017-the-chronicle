Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A MOTORIST whose car was impounded by the Bulawayo City Council for allegedly being a pirate taxi has taken the mayor and town clerk to court seeking the release of the vehicle. Mr Maxwell Mujikwa, through his lawyers Mugiya and Macharaga Law Chambers, filed an urgent chamber application at the Bulawayo High Court on Thursday citing the Bulawayo Mayor Martin Moyo, the town clerk Mr Christopher Dube and the head of Bulawayo Municipal Police as respondents.Mr Mujikwa is seeking an order that compels the respondents to immediately release his car, a Honda Fit, impounded last month.In his founding affidavit, Mr Mujikwa, said he was arrested by municipal police on January 11 while driving in the central business district.He said the council cops accused him of operating a pirate taxi. I was arrested by the Bulawayo municipal police officers who accused me of committing several traffic offences. They suspected that I operated a pirate taxi business, he said.Mr Mujikwa said despite his innocence, he was forced to pay $480, which included towing services costs. I had no choice because I was vulnerable and I ended paying the unknown fines under protest. I expected to be given my car back but the head of Bulawayo Municipal Police said he wanted to teach me a lesson and refused to release my car, he said. I went to report the matter to the police who tried to engage the respondents but it actually worsened my situation and the head of municipal police is now refusing to talk to me. Mr Mujikwa said he used his car to transport his children to school as well as going to work. It is apparent that the respondents have taken the law into their own hands and this is a clear deprivation of the right to my property. I am entitled to equal protection by the law hence the need for this court to protect my violated rights, he said. @mashnets&nbsp;
