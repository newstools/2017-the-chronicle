Ashton Mbeu NyahoraShowbiz Reporter Up and coming Afro Jazz artiste, Mbeu showed that the years he spent at Oliver Mtukudzi s Pakare Paye learning music were not in vain as he put up a polished performance at Legends Sports Diner in Bulawayo. Mbeu, for four hours, seamlessly plucked away on his acoustic guitar, capturing the sizeable crowd at the venue through a musical journey which had snippets of songs from his upcoming album Mhodzi Diaries.Mbeu blended his music with those of his mentor Tuku, with late greats such as Biggie Tembo and The Bundu Boys and James Chimombe.With the help of his band, the Mhodzi Tribe, Mbeu (seed) would be occasionally joined by patrons of the bar on stage when he sang renditions of the tunes.What was interesting and enjoyable at the show was the intimacy that extended to the crowd as couples could be seen in each other s arms.Relatively unknown to many in Bulawayo, Mbeu, Born Ashton Nyahora 25 years ago in Harare, did not let a small crowd that had gathered at the beginning of the show deter him from giving out a sterling performance.Gradually as the night wore on and the patrons knocked back drinks by the dozen, their mood mellowed and they started dancing to the melodic sounds. At the end of the show some patrons gave him the name Nhlanyelo which is seed in isiNdebele.After the show Mbeu said he was grateful to the fans who came to support him at the show. This was a humbling experience and for a first show, this was great. I want to thank those who came for the show. I hope to be in the city more, said Mbeu.Maybe his desire to be a regular feature in Bulawayo will be granted if the words of LSD s co-proprietor are anything to go by. We are in talks with Mbeu and his management team and indications are that they might become the resident band at LSD. I didn t know him too, but I must admit Pakare Paye really developed him, said Chiedza Chitehwe who s running the joint in partnership with Philemon Mushore.
