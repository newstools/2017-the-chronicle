Modern NgwenyaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS FC is yet to decide on the format to use in their search for a substantive chief executive officer, with the club acting chairman Modern Ngwenya saying they stand guided by the human resources committee. Bosso members passed a resolution at their annual general meeting that the club must appoint a chief executive officer by the end of March.The club s secretary-general Emmett Ndlovu has also been acting as CEO since the suspension of Ndumiso Gumede from all football activities in November by Zifa.Gumede s contract expired in December 2016 and he subsequently retired from football.Responding to questions during the club s weekly Thursday media briefing, Ngwenya said some prospective CEOs have submitted their CVs at Highlanders offices. Come March 31 a CEO will be here. In hiring the CEO we stand guided by the human resources committee whether to headhunt or advertise for the job, said Ngwenya.The club s human resources committee, comprising members of the board and executive, will then deal with contractual issues.Ngwenya dismissed rumours that Ndlovu is one of the people who have applied for the CEO s position.Former club vice-chairman Elkanah Dube has also distanced himself from the post, to concentrate on a private school he is heading.Nhlanhla Dube, one of a few internationally qualified sport administrators in the country, has previously been tipped to lead the Bosso secretariat.Dube did a Fifa Futuro course alongside PSL CEO Kennedy Ndebele and ex-Zifa CEO Jonathan Mashingaidze. He is a former Highlanders secretary-general.Another candidate that could be considered is Brian Moyo, a former Highlanders administrator and Zifa education officer.Nkululeko Ndlovu, a Bosso member, also possesses the credentials to head Bosso s secretariat. He is a business and development consultant as well as a member of the Zimbabwe Institute of Management.The CEO will be responsible and accountable for the day-to-day operations of the club. He or she will be expected to deliver the club s strategy and to implement decisions passed by the congress and the executive.The CEO will also be responsible for developing and implementing the club s strategic plan as well as to drive the club s businesses to profitability.Whoever gets the job will also have to set up new and professional secretariat structures.Good governance requires that there be separation of powers between the CEO and policy formulators, which is the board and executive, so the head of secretariat must be given room to operate and report independently.Previously there has been friction between the CEO and the secretary-general. @ZililoR
