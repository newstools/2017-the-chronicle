Lovemore Zigara in Gweru MIDLANDS State University (MSU) FC has appointed a new executive led by Tafirenyika Shoko following the dissolution of Tinomuda Muzikamwi s executive. Muzikamwi returned as vice-chairman in the new executive while prominent Gweru lawyer Reginald Chidawanyika is the secretary and Todd Chimunhu treasurer. Oscar Raja, Amon Gorerekufa and Martin Ncube come in as committee members and Herbert Masukume is team manager.The club has also roped in football legends Wonder Chaka and Manuel Mutumwa as advisors.MSU director of sport James Chivivi said the new executive had been mandated to ensure the club earns promotion to the PSL next season. I am pleased to announce the new executive, which is built on maturity and we believe it has what it takes to achieve our objectives. We have also appointed Chaka and Mutumwa as club advisors since they are people who have played football and managed football, said Chivivi. We are confident that their experience will add value in the growth and development of the club. We have therefore mandated the incoming executive to ensure that we come up with a team that will challenge for honours this season. We want to be playing in the Premiership in 2018. Chivivi said the club s coach Themba Chingwena will soon appoint his assistants, including one who will be based at the university s Zvishavane campus.He said the Zvishavane-based assistant will be in charge of conducting training sessions for students based in the mining town before they are seconded to the first team.Last season MSU collected 50 points and were 19 points adrift of the Central Soccer League winners Shabanie Mine and could only manage sixth position.The closest MSU came close to promotion was in 2014 when they were pipped to the championship on the last day of the season by Whawha. @lavuzigara1.
