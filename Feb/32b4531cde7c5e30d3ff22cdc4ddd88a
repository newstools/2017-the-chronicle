Basil NyabadzaSukulwenkosi Dube- Matutu, Plumtree Correspondent THE Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) has urged the Government to launch a probe into the origins of the fall army worm which is attacking crops throughout the country and threatening food security. Arda board chairman Mr Basil Nyabadza said there was a need for Government to scrutinise the quality of maize seed that was being imported to ensure that it was up to standard.The fall army worm has been attacking crops in Bulawayo, Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, Midlands and Manicaland provinces.In Matabeleland South, it has also been reported at Arda Ingwizi and Antelope Estates. As a key player in crop production we would like to appeal to Government to launch a probe in order to find the source of the fall army worm. There have been continuous attacks by this worm in various provinces which is a cause for concern. It is attacking cobs and it is breeding at a fast pace. There is a need for Government to investigate all possible sources of this worm including imported maize seed. There are several other possibilities but it s important to identify the source, Mr Nyabadza said.He said there have been worm attacks on crops in the past but not on a scale that is being reported now.Mr Nyabadza said efforts had been made to contain the fall army worm at Ingwizi and Antelope Estates but outgrowers were still affected.He said most farmers had done well in their fields but their produce was now under threat because of the pest.The Arda board chairperson raised concern over the importation of maize seed by seed distributors. There has been huge importation of maize seed over the past 12 to 18 months because local seed producers don t have the capacity to manufacture. It would be better if seeds were produced locally as we would be assured of quality products and quality produce, Mr Nyabadza said.He said Arda Ingwizi and Antelope Estates had a combined 1 200 hectares of maize crop which was expected to produce 27 000 tonnes. @DubeMatutu&nbsp;
