Gweru City Council HouseAmanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter GWERU City Council has given vendors operating at undesignated sites a two-week ultimatum to start operating from official vending sites outside the central business district (CBD). Gweru town clerk, Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza said those cooking food in the streets should move with immediate effect due to the risk of diseases.Vendors in the city have clogged pavements with goods that include clothing, fruits and vegetables, food, cosmetics, car parts and medicines.Ms Gwatipedza said council was going to forcibly remove all those who will continue conducting their business on pavements and streets starting from February 28. Following a meeting between the representatives of vendors and council held on February 8, it was recommended that all vendors in town should return to their originally allocated bays. It was observed that the majority of the vendors had deserted their bays at designated areas and were now selling their items everywhere thus congesting pavements, she said. The deadline of February 28 has been set for all vendors to return to their bays at designated areas. Those who refuse to move would be removed by force. Ms Gwatipedza said council was working to erect additional vendor bays outside the CBD. These will be allocated to those who require them. So far we have 167. Council is working flat out on the issue of completing toilets. For those who are operating illegally they are advised that they stop and apply for bays at new sites to be created including at the Swift vendor mart site, she said. @amanda49
