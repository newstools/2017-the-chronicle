Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Swaziland topflight side Manzini Wanderers technical director Julius Chakupewa has taken over the reins at Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) outfit Ivan Hoe on a one-year contract. Chakupewa, a former Masvingo United player, quit the Swazi Premiership side at the end of last season and takes over from Isaac Nyabvure, who joined ZPC Munyati.Chakupewa beat former Hardbody coach Tavaka Gumbo to the job after the club failed to meet the former Shu Shine midfielder s demands.Ivan Hoe s secretary Itai Munyanyi confirmed the appointment of Chakupewa and said they wanted to challenge for the league title. We are pleased to announce the appointment of Chakupewa as our head coach for the 2017 season. We are hoping he will help us fight for the championship this season, said Munyanyi.Ivan Hoe made a late onslaught for the championship last season, but eventually finished third on 65 points, four points adrift of eventual winners Shabanie Mine.Chakupewa possesses a German PRO Certificate as his highest coaching qualification.However, the Swaziland Football Association turned down his qualification to coach Manzini Wanderers and demanded that he produces a Caf B Licence or anything equivalent to it.This saw Manzini Wanderers appointing him as technical director, a post he quit to join the CSL outfit. @lavuzigara1.
