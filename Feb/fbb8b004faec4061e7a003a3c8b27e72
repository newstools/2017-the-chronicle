There will be an award in his name, or something like that. Van der Westhuizen s death is obviously still fresh.His wife, Amor Vittone, looked sombre as she was wheeled to the stage behind Van der Westhuizen s casket.Vittone arrived in a wheelchair and with a cast on her left leg.Sports minister Fikile Mbalula had walked to the stage first, and behind him was the team of pall-bearers, led by 1995 World Cup winning captain Francois Pienaar and Du Plessis.A problem with the sound system meant that Terblanche, facilitating proceedings, was forced to start the national anthem without any music.Fortunately for him, PJ Powers was in the Loftus stands and she belted out the anthem in what was a truly touching moment.Before all of the tributes began, Van der Westhuizen s coffin was wrapped in the South African flag by the South African police.
