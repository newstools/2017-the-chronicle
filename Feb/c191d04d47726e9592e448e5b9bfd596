Lovemore Zigara in Gweru NEWLY appointed Shabanie Mine coach Taku Shariwa has roped in Wilson Mutekede as one of his assistants, as the asbestos miners firm up for their Premiership return. Mutekede is a former coach of the now defunct Northern Region Division One side Twalumba FC. He also had a stint at Caps United as one of their junior coaches. I am happy that Mutekede agreed to join us. He brings a lot of experience, having coached several clubs, which I believe will add value to the club as we seek to make a mark in the Premiership this season, said Shariwa.Mutekede is a holder of a CAF A coaching licence.Meanwhile, former FC Platinum striker Tarisai Rukanda could make a return to Shabanie Mine and was part of the crowd that watched their practice match against ZPC Munyati on Sunday.Rukanda had been earlier linked with a move to Yadah Gunners where he has been training.Shariwa could not be drawn into discussing Rukanda s links to Shabanie Mine.The former Mutare City coach has made it clear that he needs a top notch striker if the Chinda Boys are to acquit themselves well this season.Among the new faces that featured for Shabanie Mine on Sunday are former Triangle midfielder Charles Makoto, Collen Duhwa, who was with Tsholotsho last season, and former Dynamos and Triangle defender William Mapfumo. @lavuzigara1
