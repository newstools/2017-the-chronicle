Sports Reporter REGISTRATION for the Bulawayo Netball League has opened and closes on March 11 when the provincial league holds its annual general meeting. Bulawayo Metropolitan Province will not field teams in the Zimbabwe Netball Association s Super League after teams withdrew from promotional play-offs due to lack of funding. They now hope to have a 12-team provincial league for the 2017 season.Precious Mudenge, a Bulawayo Netball League official, said most teams had picked up their registration forms and appealed to schools to join the league so they can compete against better sides. Registration forms have been given to clubs. We expect clubs interested in being part of our league to submit their forms at our AGM on March 11. We re also hoping to have a league of more than 12 teams which include high schools and tertiary institutions, said Mudenge.Last year the Bulawayo Netball League began the season with 14 teams, 11 from Bulawayo and three from Hwange.The Hwange clubs, Colliery, Mwachapa and ZPC Hwange, withdrew after playing a couple of games due to financial constraints.The 11 clubs that the league is hoping to retain are ZRP Bulawayo, Highlanders, Free Stars, Delta Sparrows, Jumbos, Fairbridge, Sobukhazi, TelOne, Khami, Lupane State University and Imbizo.@ZililoR
