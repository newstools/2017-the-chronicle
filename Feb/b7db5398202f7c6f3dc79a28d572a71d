Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent THE re-opening of Zvishavane-based mine, Sabi Gold Mine has been deferred after inspectors from the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development condemned the shaft rope at the mine. Sabi, a subsidiary of the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC), suspended operations in 2014 due to working capital constraints and a debilitating debt.However, a local investment consortium, Chandiwana Mining Cooperation injected $26 million in fresh capital into the mine to kick start operations.Under the arrangement the consortium will settle the mine s debts that also include workers salary arrears dating back to 2014, which had accumulated to $2,8 million.Sabi Gold Mine judicial manager Dr Wesley Sibanda said they are working at regularising the mine in line with recommendations by the ministry inspectors. We should have started operations but when the ministry inspectors came they condemned the rope, which leads to the shaft. We have acquired a new rope in Bulawayo and it is being tied to the shievel, he said. Once that is completed we are going to install it on the shaft and we expect operations to resume in the next two weeks. Part of the mine was vandalised by artisanal miners who were trespassing into the mine and blasting into the shafts, damaging the pillars and other infrastructure during its non-operational days.Sabi is conducting dry runs as they continue to prepare for full scale operations. The mine has been placing advertisements in the media to attract prospective employees.At full production Sabi has the capacity to produce 50 kilogrammes of gold per month with a 420 strong workforce.@lavuzigara1
