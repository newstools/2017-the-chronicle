Sports Reporter REGISTRATION for the Matabeleland Rugby Football Board (MRFB) Sevens League that is set to run for just over a month has opened. MRFB intends to use the Sevens League as a platform for players to market themselves to the Cheetahs coach Gilbert Nyamutsamba, who is scouting for players to use for the 2018 Sevens World Cup qualifiers, which start later this year.Thulani Tabulawa, MRFB chairman, said they are hoping to start the Sevens League, which is also aimed at re-igniting interest in the game, at Hartsfield Ground either this Saturday or the following weekend.Rugby, once a crowd puller in Bulawayo, has virtually collapsed in the city and the newly elected board believes the Sevens format could provide the tonic for a revival. Registration is on for our Sevens League and once we know how many teams are interested in participating in the competition, we will immediately start the games. We want to ride on the momentum of the just-ended Under-21 Cup and keep rugby fans entertained. Our hope is to start this week, but if it fails, we will begin our games the following weekend, said Tabulawa.Old Miltonians won the Under-21 Cup after edging defending champions Highlanders Panthers 13-12.OMs and Panthers are both expected to register at least two teams each to compete in the Sevens League.The other teams expected to take part include Matabeleland Warriors, Lupane State University, Ancient City of Masvingo, Police Bulldogs, Midlands State University (MSU) Shabanie Campus, Platinum Warriors, MSU (Gweru), Great Zimbabwe University, Gweru Sports Club and Nyambosi.Tabulawa said they are also working on having schools curtain raise during the Sevens League as part of their development project.@ZililoR
