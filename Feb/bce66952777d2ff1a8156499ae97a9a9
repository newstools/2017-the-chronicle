It s our first 15s game of the year, the guys have been training, we want to see if there is a gel between the youngsters and old players. We want to get as much as possible out of this game. We want to attract a lot of players who are still not sure if rugby is alive in Bulawayo, it s been a number of years since we had a team from outside the country coming to Bulawayo for pre-season matches, said Weale.Some of the notable players at Warriors are Irvine Nduwa, Sandile Lupuwana, Lloyd Machanjaira, Cleopas Makotose, Hardlife Masunda and Jafet Ndebele.On the same day, Old Miltonians clash with Canon Jaguars at Livingstone Kolobeng College in Gaborone. OMs who are under the guidance of Sables great Zivanai Dzinomurumbi, have been boosted by the return of backline player Andrea Banda from Warriors, forward Mandisa Masuku, who is on industrial attachment from Great Zimbabwe University, flyhalf Mzwandile Maoche, who has finished his studies in South Africa. They should combine well with Jason Mackay, Michael Zvakavapano and Thabani Sakupwanya.OMs and Warriors, formerly Matabeleland Busters, have over the years contributed a number of players to both the national 15s and sevens teams.Zimbabwe Rugby Union has put in place plans to revive the Inter-City League to bring competitiveness to the local game with the league set to start in March. The country last had a National Rugby League in 2014, which ended with only nine rounds of fixtures being fulfilled due to lack of funding as the sponsorship deal with Delta Beverages, who bankrolled the NRL using the Lion Lager brand ended in 2013.Teams from Bulawayo, Harare, Gweru, Mutare and Zvishavane were part of the NRL.
