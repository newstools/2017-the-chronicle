Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Government has established a new computerised system that will detect criminals and motorists who have not paid for vehicle licences at roadblocks and toll gates, Home Affairs Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo has said. Dr Chombo said since last week on Tuesday, trial runs were being held to check the effectiveness of the technology. We have come up with a system where if one comes across any roadblock, the car is scanned by the equipment and it reveals the full status of that car in terms of ownership, registration and fines which may be due and so on. Someone who may be found on the wrong side is apprehended on the roadblock, said Dr Chombo in Parliament. On the other hand, when you pass through a toll gate, the police officer will scan your vehicle and it will reveal all the details of the car and the owner of the vehicle. We are now computerised and we are assured that thieves will be arrested. However, good citizens will be able to go through these roadblocks without hassles. He said the new technology is also able to record the money paid at roadblocks. The machine is able to identify the police officer on a roadblock and the amount of money paid. It also enables the collection of funds for Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) and the local authorities and the computerised system transfers the money to respective institutions, said the Minister. @pamelashumba1
