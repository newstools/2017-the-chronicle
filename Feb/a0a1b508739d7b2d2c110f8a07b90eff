Trynos Nkomo, the owner of Bunny s Luck Mine, confirmed that they had committed to assisting the team.As part of the deal, the mine will supply the 2017 season s kit, pay the team s league affiliation fees and fund the players welfare and other logistical requirements. I ve been committed to the development of sport in Gwanda and Matabeleland South for a long time. My company works closely with communities and endeavours to assist in community development initiatives such as football. Having seen the potential to succeed shown by ZRP Gwanda, I thought why wait, let s make this happen now, said Nkomo.He said he was not only concentrating on sponsoring ZRP Gwanda, but would also help in identifying talent around Matabeleland South. I m happy to see that football is changing lives for the better in Gwanda. Even in remote villages, sporting talent abounds. I want to help create an environment that exposes that talent to bigger platforms. I have the intuition that my assistance to ZRP Gwanda and other sport teams will offer a positive experience to the community. In fact, the team has to play in the Premiership next season. With sponsorship like this, nothing will stop ZRP Gwanda from flourishing, he said.ZRP Gwanda were promoted to the Central Soccer League in 2016 and finished 11th on the table in their debut season. @NkosieLegend
