Your Worship, l can afford to give her $60 per month. I m not here because of maintenance issues. She suggested that I marry her younger sister as my third wife. It s against my religion, I want to marry a wife of my own choice, he said. I take care of my children and her but these days l spend most of the time with my second wife because she is pregnant. Mr Tashaya ordered Mudzvidzwa to pay $100 per month for maintenance and also settle his children s school fees. You have to deposit $100 per month into the applicant s bank account with effect from this month end. In addition, you have to pay school fees for your children and clear school fees arrears.
