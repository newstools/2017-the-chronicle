Dialysis MachineWalter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent THE Ministry of Health and Child Care has launched a probe into the alleged stripping of critical parts from a newly acquired dialysis machine at Masvingo General Hospital. The alleged theft was discovered last week when a Chinese engineer came to install the machine valued at $100 000.Masvingo provincial medical director Dr Amadeus Shamu said: We suspect someone could have stripped the dialysis machine of some of its critical parts that include a pump. It is unfortunate that such a thing occurred considering the role played by the machine. We have reported the matter to the police. Dr Shamu said they will also conduct their own investigations. The dialysis machine came from China and it is an engineer from China who came to the hospital last week intending to install it. It is during the installation of the critical equipment that it was discovered that some parts including a pump were missing. While police are investigating, we are also looking into the matter as the Ministry and if it is an inside job heads will roll, he saidThe dialysis machine was procured under a $100 million government to government agreement between China and Zimbabwe.The arrangement will see all 10 provincial hospitals in the country receiving a dialysis machine.The availing of a dialysis machine at the provincial referral hospital will be a relief to a number of renal patients in Masvingo province who cannot afford private medical services or travel to Harare or Bulawayo to access the services at public hospitals.@walterbmswazie2
