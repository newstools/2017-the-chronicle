The Zvishavane side s trials will be conducted by the club s new coach Mandla Lulu Mpofu.Club treasurer Munyaradzi Nyashanu said they wanted to build a strong squad that can compete and remain in the PSL. We are going to be conducting trials from Saturday until Tuesday where we hope to recruit talented players to be part of the team for this coming season.From then on, training will start with players he (Mpofu) would have identified, said Nyashanu. We are looking at building a strong team, which should be able to compete in the Premiership. Shabanie Mine is a big brand and our aim is to stay in the topflight league, he said.He said negotiations to renew contracts of players that did duty last season in the Zifa Central Soccer League have already begun.However, indications are that some players could have crossed the floor to join fellow Midlands side Chapungu United after being lured by former coach Tendai Chikuni.Chikuni is now the Chapungu head coach.There are strong indications that the Chinda Boys could lose the services of CSL Soccer Star of the Year Ricky Bota, goalkeeper Joseph Fernando and Lloyd Gwerina, who have been training with the Air Force of Zimbabwe side.The trio might leave for free since their contracts expired at the end of last year.The asbestos miners are seeking to make an impression in the Premiership this season after a three-year absence. @lavuzigara1.
