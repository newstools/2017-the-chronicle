Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Ferret team has intercepted two South African trucks that were en-route to Harare with a consignment of smuggled detergents. The Ferrets are made up of officials from Zimra, police, immigration and other security agents.The items were smuggled through Beitbridge border post after the owners made an under-declaration which resulted in them paying a paltry $2 910 in duty for both trucks.The deal which is believed to involve some Zimra officials and customs clearing agents saw the State losing a total of $29 924.50 in import duty.The Chronicle is in possession of documents showing that the consignment comprising over 5 000 boxes of Harpic detergents, Jik and Dettol soaps belongs to Collmas Investments of Harare.The Ferret team intercepted the two vehicles on January 24 but the matter has taken long to finalise with both Zimra and the police reported to be conducting intensive investigations.By the end of the day yesterday the trucks and the loot were still being kept at the Zimra container depot, where physical examination of goods is carried out.Zimra s board secretary and director of legal and corporate affairs, Ms Florence Jambwa could neither confirm nor deny the incident. Section 34A of the Revenue Authority Act [Chapter 23:11] does not permit Zimra to divulge specific details pertaining to its clients to a third party. I am, therefore, unable to respond to the questions you have asked because of the said secrecy provisions. What I can only confirm is that where goods or vehicles are detained by Zimra on or after importation, they are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Customs and Excise Act [Chapter 23:02], she said.Matabeleland South police spokesperson, Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the interception and said the matter was still under investigation. The matter is still under investigation. No arrests have been made yet and I cannot give you further details at this point, he said.However, a border official who preferred anonymity said yesterday that the trucks were intercepted near Lutumba following a tip off. We believe this has been going on for very long time and we are conducting intensive investigations into the matter. The goods were being transported by a South African company, Wil Power of Pretoria. At the moment both the trucks which were pulling two trailers each are still being kept at Condep pending finalisation of the case, said the official.&nbsp;
