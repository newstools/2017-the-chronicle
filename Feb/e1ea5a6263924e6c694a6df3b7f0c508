Ashton Mbeu NyahoraShowbiz Reporter THE musical seed that Afro Fusion musician Mbeu planted in Bulawayo at Legends Sports Diner (LSD) seems to be germinating as the powers that be at the joint have decided to make him their resident entertainer. The Oliver Mtukudzi prot g and his Mhodzi Band last week swept fans off their feet with Mbeu (seed) s debut performance at the upmarket jazz bar in Parklands suburb.So good was the performance that the bar s marketing manager Chiedza Chitehwe decided to strike a deal with the singer to perform there at least once a month. We shall be having Mbeu once a month. He is a really talented musician and he knows how to cement a strong fan base, said Chitehwe. He seems to have taken after his mentor Dr Oliver Mtukudzi and I m sure Tuku is proud of his product. Mbeu, a former Pakare Paye student, said: Legends Sports Diner gave me a platform to share my music with fans in Bulawayo. I thank them for supporting me in expanding my fan base.
