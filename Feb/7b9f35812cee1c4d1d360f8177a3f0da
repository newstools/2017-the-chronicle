Joseph MuchechetereSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission has summoned all the presidents of National Sports Associations in the country to an indaba where the country s supreme sports body is expected to read the riot act on associations not complying with dictates of the SRC Act. The meeting is set for the SRC offices in Harare this morning and all should attend without fail.The SRC said NSAs have not been performing to expected standards hence this crucial meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to provide leadership guidance to the NSA presidents and to discuss the role of presidents and the NSAs, said the SRC in statement.Part of the business to be dealt with include leading corporate governance transformation for NSAs, the role of presidents or chairpersons in ensuring that NSAs comply with the statutory provisions which include audited financial statements, presidents report, membership status in terms of SRC Act Chapter 25:15 of 1991 (revised in 1996) section 29 Paragraph 8 and 9 and the statutory Instrument 342 of 1995. The meeting was prompted by challenges faced by NSAs which resulted in them failing to comply with the provisions of the SRC Act and also general poor corporate governance exhibited by some of the NSAs. As the regulatory authority mandated by Government to oversee the sport and recreation sector, we cannot fold our hands and watch the rot and decay in the sector which we believe can significantly contribute towards the betterment of people s lives and can make a notable contribution to the Gross Domestic Product, said the SRC acting director general Joseph Muchechetere.He said the meeting will help close the skills gap and what is obtaining on the ground adding that the resolution is also in sync with the pronouncements which were made by the Minister of Sport and Recreation, Makhosini Hlongwane earlier this year when he implored the SRC board to ensure there is good corporate governance in 2017. Sport has a huge potential to transform people s lives, however, this cannot be achieved with just 10 percent of the 46 registered NSAs fully compliant with the statutory requirement while 29 percent have partially fulfilled their obligations and the remaining have not, said Muchechetere.&nbsp;
