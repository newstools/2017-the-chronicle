Richard NgaravaUNCAPPED 19-year-old fast bowler Richard Ngarava has been added to the Zimbabwean one-day international squad for the five-match series against Afghanistan. The selectors also included another seamer Carl Mumba to make it a 16-member squad on Tuesday.Ngarava has managed to make a significant progress in quick time to be in contention for his international debut during the series. He picked up five wickets and had an excellent average of just 19.80 to go with an economy of 4.30 in the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh last year. The left-arm seamer also made his list A debut for Zimbabwe A against Afghanistan A earlier this month.Even though he went wicketless in the first game, Ngarava went on to pick up three wickets to star in his team s huge win. After initially naming a 14-man squad for the home series, the selectors were in favour of adding two more names to it after the Pro50 Championship matches and hence included Mumba as well. The 21-year-old made his Test and ODI debut against Sri Lanka last year.The first ODI will be played today at the Harare Sports Club in Harare.Zimbabwe ODI SquadGraeme Cremer (C), Peter Moor, Ryan Burl, Tarisai Musakanda, Sikandar Raza, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Wellington Masakadza, Donaldo Tiripano, Tendai Chatara, Christopher Mpofu, Nathan Waller, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Carl Mumba, Richard Ngarava.
