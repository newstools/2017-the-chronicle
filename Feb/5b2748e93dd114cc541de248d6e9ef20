Dydimus MutasaNduduzo Tshuma, Political EditorZIMBABWE People First leader Dr Joice Mujuru on Wednesday sacked seven top officials in her party as internal fights threaten to destroy the faction riddled opposition movement. In a statement, Dr Mujuru announced the sacking of Mr Rugare Gumbo, Mr Didymus Mutasa, Ms Margaret Dingo, Mr Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, Mr Luckson Kandemiri, Mr Munacho Mutezo and Mr Cloudious Makova.Mujuru accused the seven of being Zanu-PF agents whose agenda was to stall progress in the party.She said more heads were set to roll in the party to weed out perceived agents. As a result we have decided to eject some of the colleagues and comrades we thought would stand with the People s cause but have chosen to be agents of the regime. All sorts of tricks, ranging from coup d tat and sophisticated infiltration, have taken centre stage with a view to delaying the People s cause of unequivocal liberation, said Dr Mujuru in her statement. We assure Zimbabweans that more heads are going to roll in this revolutionary cleansing exercise. We remain committed to the democratisation of Zimbabwe.
