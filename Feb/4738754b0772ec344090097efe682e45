Ngqwele Dube, Sports Correspondent THE Zifa technical development committee has recommended a reduction of coaching courses fees with changes being effected this year. There had been complaints over the fees charged by the football motherbody as exorbitant and a deterrent to most aspiring coaches to attend.A member of the committee and Caf football instructor, Gibson Homela said there were various motivating factors that saw them make the decision. Zifa s standardisation for coaching qualifications comes into effect this year with only qualified coaches being allowed to sit on the technical bench for the different tiers of the league.Homela said fees would be reduced by different amounts ranging between $20 and $200. Grassroots and Level One courses would now command a fee of $80 down from $100 while those aiming to attain Level Two would have to part ways with $100, $20 lower than the previous fee. Caf C and Caf B courses are now set to attract fees of $200 and $400 respectively from $300 and $600. Homela said charges for the Caf A badge remains at $1 000 but would be reviewed in due course. There is no single reason that made us recommend the reduction in the fees but we considered a multiple factors among them concerns that the rates were high in comparison to other countries in the region. Concerning Caf A we felt that others are doing the course and have paid so it would be unfair to alter the fees at this point in time, he said.The former Warriors mentor said Zifa had to set higher fees because the courses are self-funding while other countries charges are subsidised. According to the new coach standardisation only gaffers that have attained Caf A would be eligible to be head coach and assistant of Premier League teams while one needs Caf B or Level 3 or 4 to coach a team plying in Division One and Division 2, 3 and 4 coaches need Caf C or Level 3 or 4, a similar requirement for those coaching at tertiary level.A coach at junior level and at primary and secondary schools needs to have completed a Level Two or grassroots certificate.In a circular released to Premier Soccer League clubs, Zifa revealed that coaches that have previously won the championship are exempted from the standardisation if they do not hold Caf A.The circular written by Zifa acting chief executive officer, Joseph Mamutse reads: Please note that previous championship winning coaches in the top league are exempted from the standardisation if they are not holders of a Caf A Licence but have to attend refresher courses regularly. Goalkeepers coaches must have at least an elementary goalkeeping coaching certificate .The document revealed there are 41 holders of the Caf A badge with 32 attending the course in Harare, 114 have so far attained Caf B and 221 have passed Caf C countrywide.There are 4000 male and 200 female coaches who hold Level One to Four and two women has passed Caf B the same number that attained Caf C.@rasmthembo
