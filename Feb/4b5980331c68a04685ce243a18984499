I m here to demystify the issue of Killer T being dead. This is part of the art that we re creating. What we want to do is to cross boundaries and really address the issues people are afraid to address. Death is just death guys everyone will die even me I ll die. Don t be hung up with a coffin it s just a piece of wood and we did that to create art and visuals for a song that talks about what it talks about, said Blaqs.He said the music video will be out sometime soon. Soon people will understand what we were doing with the concept of the music video. They shall love it for our creativity, said Blaqs.
