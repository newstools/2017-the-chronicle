Sports Reporter THE Gwanda women s soccer tournament that had been scheduled for Selonga Secondary School on Saturday has been cancelled due to fears of Cyclone Dineo. Tournament sponsor David Moyo said following a report by the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) that a tropical cyclone might hit the country, with Matabeleland South likely to be hardest hit, the competition had been postponed to a later date. The committee saw it fit to postpone the tournament following the warning of floods from the Meteorological Services Department. We were going to be joined by Gatsi Queens from the Eastern Highlands. It will be very difficult for them to come knowing about the possibility of floods. We are going to announce the date for the competition once it s safe to play and hopefully that will be soon, said Moyo.He said everything had been set for the tournament, with the Bulawayo-based Zifa Southern Region women s soccer outfits Street Set and New Orleans having confirmed their participation.@khumzallen
