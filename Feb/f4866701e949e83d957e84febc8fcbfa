The meeting, which was held on Monday and Tuesday this week, was under the auspices of the Community Sports Development Programme but we had a deliberate theme, Introduction to the modern game of football as you aware that Binga was recently granted affiliate status.The enthusiasm and eagerness shown by all concerned in Binga is a sign that the district can contribute immensely towards grassroots football development in the province as a whole. I urge Hwange FC to focus on this district for natural soccer talent going forward, said Tshuma.The course facilitator was a veteran of the game, Weekly Mwale who is the Sports and Recreation Commission s provincial football instructor.Mwale is also a former Hwange player and coach and Zimbabwe national Under-17 goalkeepers coach.Meanwhile, the Binga 2B league s affiliation fees have been pegged at $300 with a flexible payment plan having been put in place to cushion teams in light of the tough economic environment. The first payment of $100 is expected by the end of the first week of March with the payment for the technical bench and player registration given a deadline of March 17.The second and third tranches of $100 each are expected to be paid end of April and May 2017 respectively. We want to give the teams ample time to pool resources together so that all the teams will be able to participate in this new league. added Tshuma.The Zifa Mat North league, incorporating Binga(2B) and 2A (Hwange, Victoria Falls and Dete) will hold its Annual General Meeting on March 25 at Chinotimba Primary School in Victoria Falls at 10am.The league will then commence on the second week of April 2017.@tobymandox
