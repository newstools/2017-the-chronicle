As reported by TshisaLIVE Anele Mdoda will be moving slots at 947 to the breakfast show after Darren Whackhead Simpson resigned from the Breakfast Xpress. Darren confirmed the news on his show yesterday morning. I set myself goals when I took over this show in 2010 and I believe that I have achieved everything he said.The funnyman said that while people only hear him on air from 6AM to 9AM he wakes up at 4AM and very often only leaves the office at 9PM. The show comes with a lot of responsibility and I went up and told management that something has got to change.There was a lot of backwards and forwards and this show will be moving to the afternoon. I ll be able to tuck my kids in at night. For a family man the afternoon drive is the best option. Sowetan.
