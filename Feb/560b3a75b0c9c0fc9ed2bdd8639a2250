Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter HARARE Athletics Board (HAB) secretary-general Silas Muringani says all is set for the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) JM Busha Open Track and Field triangular series at the National Sports Stadium B Arena on Sunday. Muringani said they were expecting twice the number of athletes that took part in last week s track and field events held at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. I can roughly say 95 percent of the work has been done. The route for the event is already in place and what is left is for athletes to register then we are good to go. We are expecting twice the number of athletes that were in Bulawayo last week for the track and field events. We are also hoping for high performances since everyone is in that competitive mood following last week s competition, said Muringani.He said registration for the competition will begin on Sunday at 6AM while the first race will start at 9AM.The competition will see athletes competing in 15 different categories, which include javelin, shot put, discus, high jump, triple jump, long jump, 100m, 200m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 4 400m and 4 100m relays.The JM Busha Open Track and Field competition is divided into three series, with the second leg of the event set for White City Stadium on March 11 and the final leg at the National Sports Stadium on May 25.Athletes must compete in the first two legs to qualify for the finals where the best 16 athletes in each event will contest. The top three athletes in each event will walk away with prizes. This is a very big event and the fact that it s an elimination competition will push athletes to their best performances. We had a couple of concerns, which include the rains and the football match that will be played at the National Sports Stadium, but I don t think it will affect us if we start our programme on time, Muringani said.- @khumzallen
