Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange AMBITIOUS Zifa Southern Region Division One League newcomers Mosi Rovers FC have selected a new executive committee to run the club s affairs as preparations for the 2017 season gather momentum. Former club secretary-general Mubita Mwanda is the new chairman, taking over from Bonani Nyathi.Mwanda promised to prioritise players welfare. The faith shown in me by the club members is humbling. I have trust in the whole team as we have appropriately blended experience with new blood, said Mwanda. One important recipe for success is player motivation and welfare; hence the executive will speedily work on concluding negotiations with a potential foreign partner and a number of local stakeholders that can assist us in this project. We have slightly over 50 paying members and I am inviting community members to join the team and make a huge difference in our quest to bring Premier League football to this resort town (Victoria Falls) in 2018, he said.Other members of the new executive voted in are Ntuntukho Moyo (vice-chairman), Mduduzi Dlodlo (secretary-general), Tawanda Makaure (treasurer) and committee members Tedius Dube, Simon Moyo and Ngqabutho Moyo.Victoria Falls mayor Sifiso Mpofu and tourism company Wild Horizons (Pvt) Ltd Finance Director Wirimai Chimbongore are the club s patrons.Team manager Silas Zimbiti and welfare manager Moeketsi Ndlovu retained their positions in the technical set-up alongside head coach Phumulo Mathe.Mathe said he will only make a few additions to the team and retain the bulk of the players that did duty in their promotion from Division Two.Players who excelled for Rovers last year include Houghton Mkhwananzi, Ndabazabo Ndlovu, Lenon Muronzi, Tyson Ncube, Thabani Ndlovu, Leib Chiyoko, Munyaradzi Muchenje, Wellington Ncube and Definite Tsikwa.The team is still conducting trials and the 2017 squad will be announced at the beginning of March.@tobymandox
