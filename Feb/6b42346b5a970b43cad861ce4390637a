Paul NgwenyaAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter FORMER Tsholotsho FC midfielder Paul Ngwenya will re-join newly promoted Premier Soccer League (PSL) outfit Black Rhinos for the 2017 season. Ngwenya was on a season&#8217;s loan with Iziqholo ZeZhwane for the 2016 season where he made a few appearances off the bench.Black Rhinos secretary-general Camble Sithole confirmed that Ngwenya would be returning to the army side as part of their squad for 2017. We are retaining our player from Tsholotsho as we had sent him on a one-year loan. The aim was to give him top flight experience and now that we are back in the PSL, we definitely need his services. We believe he is the kind of player who can play an important role in the army side during our top flight journey,&#8221; said Sithole. We started our training sessions two weeks ago and our aim is to avoid embarrassing situations of coming in and out of the top flight. We want to stay and not make numbers. A few guys are still trying their luck with the team and soon we will have an official announcement on who will be joining us in the 2017 season. In the technical department, the team is keen on retaining all its staff members, but we are yet to see the results, he said.Following a resolution by Zifa to drop two teams and promote four from the regional Division One leagues, Black Rhinos will be making a return to top flight football since their demotion in 2013.They will be joined in the Premiership by Southern Region Division One champions Bantu Rovers, the Central Region s Shabanie Mine and Yadah Gunners from the Eastern Region.@khumzallen
