The coaching clinic is on and we ve asked the Sports Journalists Association (Spoja) Southern Region chapter to inform its members so that members of the media covering rugby get an appreciation of the game. This is a beginners course and Johnbosco Muamba and Denver Wannies from Rugby Africa and World Rugby will be in the country to do a quality assurance on the course, said Sibanda.MRFB chairman Thulani Tabulawa said registration for the coaching course has opened. Those interested in doing the beginners coaching course can register with our office at Hartsfield Ground. As MRFB we want to spread rugby to all corners of our region and to do so we have to train the trainers so that they impart the right knowledge to the youngsters. We re also looking forward to having members of the media coming on board so that they have a better understanding of the sport, said Tabulawa.Spoja Southern Region chairman Muziwethu Hadebe said: Our members desire to cover all sporting disciplines and as such, attending workshops that can enhance their knowledge is always their desire. We re grateful to ZRU and MRFB for inviting our members and we hope to organise more training programmes for our members so that they become all-round sports journalists. @ZililoR
