Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter MATABELELAND North Province risks an outbreak of water borne diseases as Blair toilets are overflowing due to heavy rains, thereby contaminating boreholes. Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka said the province was at high risk of water bone diseases as villagers were drinking water from unsafe water bodies.Dr Masuka said it has also been noted that the heavy rains have resulted in an increase in the water table, hence giving a rise to levels of Blair toilets in some areas. Toilets are reportedly overflowing and that rise of levels is also causing contamination of water in boreholes and shallow wells. We re in the process of determining the affected areas and the extent of effects, he said. In some areas such as Umguza District, villagers are reportedly using water from untreated sources such as rivers and dams. They have become reluctant to first treat the water before using it for drinking and cooking, risking contraction of diseases. Umguza District Medical Officer Ms Tatenda Nhapi said the district has recorded a number of diarrhoea cases linked to the use of contaminated water. We have recorded a number of diarrhoea cases in Mbembesi area and investigations show that they are due to the use of unsafe water. We are currently doing water quality analysis tests, she said.Matabeleland North acting Provincial Administrator Mrs Enert Sithole said there was a need to educate members of the public on dangers of drinking unsafe water. The province is at risk and solution number one is boiling all water before drinking. Now that even boreholes are becoming contaminated, water from those sources should be boiled too, she said.-@winnie_masara&nbsp;
