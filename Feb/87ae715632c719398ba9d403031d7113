Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Chapungu goalkeeper Brighton Muchambo was laid to rest at Land Park Cemetery in Marondera yesterday. Muchambo died at Thornhill Airforce Hospital in Gweru on Monday after a short illness.A funeral parade led by base commander Group Captain Elisha Masakadza was held in his honour at Thornhill Airbase on Wednesday.Masakadza, who was standing in for Air Force of Zimbabwe Commander Air Marshal Perrance Shiri, described Muchambo as a loyal cadre always willing to undertake any assigned task.Former Chapungu goalkeeper Innocent Chogugudza, who also coached Muchambo after hanging up his gloves, described the deceased as a hardworking individual, who was willing to listen to advice. I worked with Muchambo when he came to Chapungu in 1996 as my understudy. He was a good goalkeeper and that saw him graduating early into the first team, and it was because of his talent that I became a better goalkeeper. He later became a friend of mine, as he was my neighbour, and that friendship transcended to our children up to this day, said Chogugudza. When I became coach, he showed respect to me unlike in other instances where players do not show respect to players they have played alongside. Muchambo s burial was attended by the Chapungu executive, technical team, players and supporters, Zifa Central Soccer League board member Pithius Shoko, Caps United players, who accompanied Jorum Muchambo, younger brother to Brighton, friends and relatives. @lavuzigara1
