Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent CLOSE to 5 000 senior citizens in Bulawayo are benefiting from the council rebate scheme that allows them to pay only 50 percent of their rates. The rebate scheme is targeted at those aged 70 years and above and ordinarily cannot afford to pay their monthly rates.Responding to The Chronicle s emailed questions, Bulawayo City Council (BCC) senior public relations executive Mrs Nesisa Mpofu said the scheme, which started in 2009, was now benefiting close to 5 000 people. On May, 6, 2009, council passed a resolution that senior citizens aged 70 years and above would be eligible for the 50 percent rate rebate. To date 4 923 senior citizens have benefited from the rate rebate scheme, said Mrs Mpofu.She said most of the beneficiaries live in some of the city s oldest suburbs such as Mzilikazi, Njube, Iminyela, Mabutweni, Old Pumula, Queens Park, Sauerstown, Richmond and North End.Mrs Mpofu said the rebate system targets senior citizens only but there was some flexibility in implementing the system. There is no council social protection policy covering those who are below the age of 70 except for isolated cases of people with disabilities and child headed households where social workers investigate and assess these for recommendation to council for consideration, she said.Mrs Mpofu said some residents were benefiting from the municipality s social protection policy through the provision of 5 000 litres of free water to every household on a monthly basis.Recently, the city s Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube, said through the council s social protection policy the municipality paid school fees for 224 disadvantaged pupils. In 2016, 224 vulnerable but bright students benefited from the council s bursary scheme tenable to 28 high schools in the high density suburbs of the city. This assistance included payment for examination fees for those children sitting for Ordinary Levels. The bursary went a long way indeed in meeting these children s educational needs, said Mr Dube.@nqotshili
