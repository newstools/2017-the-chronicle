FORMER Zimbabwe coach Phil Simmons returns to Harare Sports Club this week, this time in the colours of Afghanistan, where he has taken up a role as consultant of the Asians. Simmons left the Zimbabwe job in acrimony before he joined Ireland in 2013 and guided them to a controversial win over the Chevrons in a World Cup qualifier in Australia.He left after six successful years to take charge of his native West Indies.But last September the 53-year-old former Test opener was dismissed, with Joel Garner taking temporary charge.The Afghanistan Cricket Board said Simmons would assist head coach Lalchand Rajput on technical issues.As well as the four-day Intercontinental Cup matches, Ireland will play Afghanistan in five one-day internationals and three T20 games, all in Greater Noida.Under Simmons, Ireland qualified for the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, achieving wins over Test nations England, West Indies and Zimbabwe.The Windies have since appointed ex-Australia batsman Stuart Law as Simmons full-time successor.
