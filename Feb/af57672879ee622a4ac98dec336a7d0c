The upsurge in cases of armed robbery is a cause for concern and calls for new counter-strategies. The police said at the weekend that they are disturbed by the increase in armed robbery cases involving the use of firearms. National police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said police were worried by the upsurge in armed robberies countrywide.She said the robbers are after money hence they are targeting places where they suspect large sums of money are being kept.Snr Asst Comm Charamba urged members of the public not to keep large amounts of money at their business premises or homes as doing so puts their lives at risk.Last week robbers brandishing pistols and an AK47 rifle raided Zuva and Total service stations in Bulawayo and got away with cash and airtime recharge cards valued at $1 260 as well as cellphones.On February 7 another group of robbers wearing masks pounced on Zuva Service Station in Bulawayo s Pumula North suburb and got away with undisclosed cash and cellphones. On the following day, robbers raided Sakunda Service Station in Chitungwiza, blew up a safe and got away with $3 398.On the same day two armed robbers attacked a shopkeeper at Pangolin Business centre in Masvingo but failed to rob him after he fought back. The shopkeeper was, however, shot twice in the back and the left thigh.The increase in armed robberies confirms that there are many guns in the country that are in wrong hands. The police and members of the public should therefore work together to rid society of these undesirable elements that are disturbing the people s peace.It is fortunate that so far no life has been lost to these armed robbers but police need to change counter strategies in order to arrest these robbers whose place is jail.Members of the public on their part should provide police with information because these robbers stay in the communities and come from families. We have said it before that those that provide a haven for criminals are accomplices in crime.In response to the increase in armed robberies, police in Bulawayo are carrying out a firearms audit. This exercise, we believe, should be extended to all corners of the country in order to account for all guns including those now in wrong hands.There could be a need for the police to review qualifications for one to be issued with a gun licence given this disturbing trend whereby guns are being abused.We want to once again implore members of the public to work closely with the police to fight crime including armed robbery. Criminals can only be flashed out of their hiding if members of the public alert the police.
