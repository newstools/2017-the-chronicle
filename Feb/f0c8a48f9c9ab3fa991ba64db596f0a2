Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP returnees Shabanie Mine will conclude their trials for prospective players today as the club seeks those that will do duty for the club in the 2017 PSL campaign. The Chinda Boys trials started last Friday following the appointment of Taku Shariwa as the new head coach.Shariwa took over the post after Mandla Mpofu, who had been offered the position, spurned the offer at the 11th hour and instead joined Bulawayo City as assistant coach.The former Mutare City Rovers coach replaced Tendai Chikuni, who joined Chapungu.Shariwa said the trial period had gone well, but the side is still to find quality strikers for them to make a mark in the topflight league. I am happy with the turnout and we might be rounding off our trials today (yesterday) or tomorrow (today). I am happy that we have managed to find some talented youngsters whom we feel can make a difference in the premiership, said Shariwa. We also have some experienced players who have also come to fortify the team, but the challenge we have for now is that of strikers. We have not managed to get quality strikers and with the financial situation at the club, we might be forced to wait for free agents to be part of the team. He said pre-season preparations will start in earnest soon.William Mapfumo, who was with Triangle last season, and former Amagagasi player Clifton Mwale were among those that attended the trials.Others include Moosa Ismail, who claimed to have played for South African side Black Aces Under-18 team. Tarisai Rukanda, who was released by FC Platinum and has been training with PSL new boys Yadah Gunners, was part of the crowd that watched Shabanie trialists going through their paces.The presence of Rukanda ignited speculation that he could find his way to the Chinda Boys should a deal with Prophet Walter Magaya s team not materialise.@lavuzigara1
