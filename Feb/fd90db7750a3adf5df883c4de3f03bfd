Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief MAJOR supply dams in Gweru and Kwekwe are now spilling. At around the same time last year, dam levels in both towns were below 50 percent.According to statistics from the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa), Gweru and Kwekwe s supply dams are now at an average 101percent full.Zinwa Corporate Communications and Marketing manager, Mrs Marjorie Munyonga, said Gweru s main supply dam, Gwenhoro, now stands at 102,5 percent while White Waters and Amapongokwe dams are at 101,8 percent and 103 percent full.For Kwekwe, Sebakwe dam is at 102 percent full. Gwenhoro dam is at 102 percent, while White Waters and Amapongokwe dams are at 101, 8 percent and 103 percent respectively. Sebakwe is at 102 percent. The dam levels on average have risen to 102 percent compared to the 46 percent recorded last year during the same period. When the dams start spilling, that s when we start counting from above 100 percent, she said.Mrs Munyonga said dam levels continue to rise as a result of the rains being received across the country. Over the past days, there have been incidents of small dams being washed away or breaching. These small dams are largely private dams on people s properties or communal dams which are not under the purview of Zinwa. Owners of such dams have an obligation under the Water Act to take all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their dams and the surrounding places, she said. The spilling of dams raises the risk of flooding for communities downstream. People in the areas should take caution when crossing rivers and are advised to ensure the safety of any irrigation equipment that may be in the rivers. @pchitumba1
