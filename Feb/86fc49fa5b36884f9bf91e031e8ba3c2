Speaking on the sidelines of the three-day International Rugby Level One coaching course that ended at Hartsfield Ground on Saturday, Kumpasa, who is also the Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) national women s development manager, bemoaned the absence of women in local coaching structures.He applauded Loice Maburuse and Loveness Mangore, the only two female participants that were part of 20 people who attended the three-day coaching course. It s good to see ladies taking part in such programmes and our wish is to have more of them attending such clinics so that they spearhead development of women s rugby. We had two ladies (Maburuse and Mangore) attending this three-day International Rugby Level One coaching course and we hope they won t be lost to the sport. It is our belief that women, especially teachers who interact with pupils at schools, should have a big role to play in development of sport, hence our call to have more female teachers attending rugby training programmes, said Kumpasa.He said female teachers could train as coaches or referees.The three-day course also covered laws of the game, match-officiating and risk management.World Rugby and Rugby Africa regional development officer for Eastern and Southern Africa Johnbosco Muamba officiated at the programme, whose other facilitators were Kumpasa, Simba Dangah and Jacque Neil.The 20 participants are expected to write a World Rugby online examination to check if they have grasped the basics of the sport.Maburuse and Mangore were happy with the programme. This was an eye opener because we got to do and understand the practical side of the sport so that we can teach the youngsters correct things, said Maburuse.Mangore said: As a teacher, I now understand the sport better. Hopefully I ll be able to impart this knowledge to the youngsters and get more girls participating in rugby. Mangore and Maburuse graduated from Hillside Teachers College last year.@ZililoR
