I mixed soda, coca cola and a traditional herb and I drank the concoction in order to terminate the pregnancy. I wanted to cut all ties with my in-laws and I decided that the best way was for me to terminate the pregnancy. My in-laws have been abusing and harassing me ever since I started living with them a month ago. They have been accusing me of using the pregnancy in order to trap their son into marrying me. They have never wanted me at their home, said Ndlovu.Prosecuting, Ms Charlote Katerere said Ndlovu terminated her pregnancy on February 6.She said the crime was discovered by her sister-in-law, Ms Thandolwenkosi Sibanda, who lives at the same homestead. On 6 February around 9AM, Ms Sibanda went into Ndlovu s bedroom hut to clean and wash clothes as her sister-in-law had complained that she wasn t feeling well. Ms Sibanda collected the dirty clothes and realised some were soaked in blood. She questioned Ndlovu who admitted to have terminated her one month pregnancy, said Ms Katerere.She said Ms Sibanda alerted family elders who reported the matter to the police.@DubeMatutu
