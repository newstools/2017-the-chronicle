Crystabel Chikayi, Business Reporter Homestead Conference Centre is a trusted venue for various events including weddings, parties, workshops and corporate functions, among others. The conference centre is located along George Silundika Street, between 3rd and 4th Avenues.Homestead Conference Centre houses two halls with one having a capacity of 200 while the other can house up to 1 000 people.It has lush green lawns as well as water features that contribute to its aesthetics perfect for outdoor events.The establishment has been running for a year under the stewardship of Mrs Desiree Zhou-Malaba. I love this place, and I m confident that by next year, it ll be one of the most sought after conference centres in Bulawayo. So far, the biggest competitor is the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair exhibition centre and that s the level my conference centre is getting to. People may not understand but its God who gave me this place and I know it will grow big, said Mrs Zhou-Malaba.She said the conference centre has so far hosted shows, weddings and workshops.Next month, Homestead Conference Centre is set to host a wedding expo.The expo, which will be held on March 4, will be a chance for brides and bridegrooms to meet with different service providers in preparation for their weddings. There ll be different service providers like the video production teams, makeup artists, ring makers and wedding gown sellers. Brides and grooms will get to choose who is best to hire for their wedding considering the different competitive prices. The wedding expo will start at 10AM and end at 8PM and the entry fee will just be $1. We ll be giving away prizes for the best brides. The event is worthwhile and we re looking forward to great attendance, said Mrs Zhou-Malaba.
