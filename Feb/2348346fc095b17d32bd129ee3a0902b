Modern NgwenyaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter IN a shocking revelation, it has emerged that Highlanders juniors were not training during the week and only came together on match days last season. The matter has been kept under wraps as the Bosso executive chose instead to concentrate on the first team.Highlanders acting chairman Modern Ngwenya confirmed the strange arrangement, but claimed that he only got to know about it late in 2016 when their games were almost over.Highlanders have four representative junior sides, starting from the Under-14s that are coached by Dan Ngwenya, the Under-16s under Siza Khoza, Under-18s coached by Gift Lunga Jr and the reserve side that plays as Bosso 90 in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League and is coached by Melusi Mabaleka Sibanda. I only got to know about this unfortunate thing late. It s something which should not have happened. We are Highlanders, said Ngwenya.The reason given for not training was non-availability of diesel for the team bus. Highlanders have three buses and the players are collected daily for training sessions from their various suburbs.Once known for its vibrant junior policy, Highlanders have over the years failed to maintain that position, with few players graduating to the senior team.Those fortunate enough to make a breakthrough rarely get game time as the coaches prefer experienced players.@skhumoyo2000
