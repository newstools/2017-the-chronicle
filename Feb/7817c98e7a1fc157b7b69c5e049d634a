Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter THERE was no outright winner at the rain interrupted two-day Falcon College Junior Schools Cricket Festival which ended on Saturday. Only one round of fixtures was possible in the 10-overs a-side competition on opening day on Friday before heavy rains pounded Esigodini, causing the abandonment of all matches lined up for the opening day as the pitches were waterlogged.With slim hopes of action on Saturday, the 12 participating schools then requested tournament organisers to tweak the fixtures in order for them to play against teams they would not normally play against during the season.Ruzawi, Petra, Hartmann House, Springvale, Whitestone, Lilfordia, Barwick, Murray McDougal, Bryden, St John s Preparatory School, Carmel and Victoria Falls Primary were the participants at this year s fiesta.With the rain, which is pounding the whole country, sparing Esigodini on Saturday save for a slight drizzle, all matches lined up on the last day went ahead smoothly.Ruzawi, who went into the festival as defending champions, were impressive and victorious in all their four matches on Saturday, and so did Hartmann House and St John s Prep.Despite outstanding displays by the youngsters, who showed lots of enthusiasm on and off the field, the tournament trophy will remain at Falcon College until next year s festival.Falcon College headmaster Reginald Querl lauded parents that came out to cheer on their children and also thanked the sponsors, Dairibord, Fazak and Introwise for their continued support.National team coach Heath Streak, whose son Harry, an all-rounder, turned out for Petra, said he was amazed by the amount of talent on display at the tournament.Streak believes the future of the game is in safe hands as long as the talent is properly nurtured by Zimbabwe Cricket.The Falcon College Primary Schools Cricket Festival began in 2005 as the brainchild of Querl, with the aim of introducing primary school pupils to life at Falcon College through a weekend of competitive sport and involvement in other College activities, such as sleeping in dormitories, eating in the dining hall and interacting with Falcon learners.Ruzawi School has dominated the event over the years, winning every tournament, except once when St John s Prep Schools scooped it. @Mdawini_29
