&nbsp;Showbiz Reporter LOCAL gospel group Vocal Ex is set to launch its second DVD/album titled, I Live To Worship (Shiloh) at the Word of Life Auditorium in Bulawayo on Saturday. Entry to the launch, which will feature performances by up-and-coming gospel groups Dumisa, Tehiillah One Spirit, D-Song and Carlos Jiri, has been pegged at $5 for adults and $2 for children with doors opening at 3PM.Vocal Ex director Thembelani Mdlaziba said the DVD album live recording was a thank you to God. Our concentration and focus this year is centred on the giver of gifts that we use to minister his word. That s why we call this edition Shiloh as we want to be at the altar where the convent we made with God is located, said Mdlaziba.He said the DVD launch comes on the back of last year s successful launch of I Live To Worship (Ebenezer) DVD that opened a lot of doors for them. We had the opportunity to work with people like Takesure Zamar, Ayanda Shange, Avis Dlamini, Nqubeko Mbatha, Wenyasha, Eric Moyo and Ntokozo Mbambo. This opened a lot of doors for the group through the interactions and guidance from our mentors. We re certain this new album will be better than the first. Vocal Ex was founded by Mdlaziba, Eric Moyo and Mkhululi Bhebhe in July 2013. The three used to sing together at church during their high school days before forming a fully-fledged religious musical group.
