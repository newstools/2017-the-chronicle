Bruce Ndlovu Staggering forward before shuffling sideways the next instant, a ginger-haired young man dances on a street in Lobengula West. To the uninitiated, it looks like he is about to fall or break both his knees but surprisingly he maintains his balance, spinning on his toes like a ballerina before lifting a finger as if to admonish those that thought he could not maintain his well choreographed rhythm.In the yard, a DJ is similarly engrossed in his craft, barely lifting his eyes to take a glance at the swelling crowd dancing or nodding to every tune he dishes out from the decks.Both of them seem not to notice the gathering clouds, a warning of heavy rains likely to fall.This was the scene when Saturday Leisure visited the Chronicles of House Nation s (COHN) Sunday Chillas last week.People mingled freely on the streets or in the yard of the house where the party proper was taking place.The DJ booth was the party s nerve centre, with some of the city s masters of the decks taking turns to belt out the best house tunes.While there were chairs available for a select few, most preferred to stand as if afraid that a DJ might throw in their favourite track while they are sitting thereby catching them unaware.With no alcohol available for sale, attendees brought their own bottles and soon convenient instant friendships were started and as many as five pairs of lips were sharing the same glass of brandy or whisky.In the shadows, clouds of smoke went up as the smokers also indulged themselves.Sunday s Chillas, which saw many from Lobengula and even many more from outside the suburb turn up to appreciate deep house tunes, is just one of many such parties which have been taking place since Chronicles of House Nation (COHN) came together back in 2014.Formed by the trio of Bongani DBongz Deeper Ndlovu, Mandlenkosi Master M Mkandla and Denzil DaHousemaniac Zulu, COHN s basic concept is to hold a party in a Bulawayo suburb every weekend. The three have been joined by a host of Bulawayo DJs who share their love and appreciation of the deep house genre.Wherever they have gone they have attracted big crowds and while all the parties are held in the western suburbs of the City of Kings, armies of party lovers from the eastern half of the city have found themselves dancing to the deep house beat in unfamiliar places like Luveve, Nketa and Magwegwe.Such has been the popularity of COHN that those who have attended one would not want to miss the next. Word is spread through the grapevine until everyone knows the venue and those that have never attended but are near where the party is held, the deep house drum directs them.While they are thriving because of acceptance by the outgoing party lovers in Bulawayo, COHN came into existence because of rejection. We managed to link up with a lot of deep house heads who couldn t make it in the city s clubs due to the fact that the genre is not recognised there in most instances, said COHN s Denzil Zulu on the sidelines of last Sunday s party.Despite the fact that house music has a lot of followers in Bulawayo, commercial house reigns supreme, pushing those that love the deeper, soulful variety of the genre to the sidelines. According Zulu, their main objective is to broaden appreciation of the genre. We want to raise the level of appreciation that people have for deep house and that includes the training of young DJs who re also interested in the craft.That is why we see ourselves as more of a youth empowerment organisation because we show them how to make a living from this, he said.There is no doubt that the intoxicating party vibe is the reason many follow the group wherever they go on any given Sunday but Zulu sees COHN as more than mere party starters.In a similar way to how the youths of Mbare gave birth to Zim dancehall in their bedroom studios, COHN views venues like the three roomed semi-detached house where last week s party was held as an ideal nest from which a larger movement can find its wings. Harare has its own dancehall so as COHN we re trying to bring something different and create our own Bulawayo sound. That is why we play music by the likes of Skaiva, Mdu Sevan, Cooperman, Djembe Monks and Sol Native. In addition we are looking for female DJs to groom. We re happy we have inspired other movements like Sound Motion who we consider our brothers.This for us represents growth, he said.If COHN is to become a fully fledged music movement they need to play music of their own and Zulu believes that 2017 is the year that they will give Bulawayo house music addicts their fix. We have compilations and mixes coming up but we will continue to give a platform to the music of local producers, he said.Last Sunday as bodies writhed and twisted to the rhythm of the house beat, it became apparent that with the right focus and drive, COHN can achieve more.&nbsp;
