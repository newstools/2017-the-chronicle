Mr Fullard GwasiraZESA has acquired new generator transformers for the Kariba South Extension project from China worth $7 million. Spokesperson Mr Fullard Gwasira said equipment comprising three generator transformers has arrived, marking a major milestone towards the completion of one of the key power generation projects in the country. The transformers are for unit 7 and 8 of the Kariba South Extension projects and will improve capacity by 600 megawatts. They also come at a time when the authority is stepping up efforts to ensure smooth electricity generation within the country for the next 50 years, he told ZBCtv.The delivery of the equipment is an indicator of the success of Sino-Zim mega deals, which are in line with objectives of the country s economic blue print, Zim-Asset cluster on infrastructure and utilities.Sino Hydro representative Mr Deju Zhang said: The project is progressing on a positive note, and is a reflection of strong bilateral economic and investment relations between Zimbabwe and China. The power utility has announced that construction works to expand Kariba South Power Station s generation capacity was on course to meet the December 2017 target with the first unit expected to start pumping 150MW into the national grid by Christmas this year.The overall project progress was at 71 percent.This comes as ZPC has been allocated more water by Zambezi River Authority for power generation this year while the expected normal to above normal rains are projected to result in significant inflows into Lake Kariba.Kariba Power Station has an installed capacity of 750MW but will have its capacity increased to a combined 1 050MW when units 7 and 8 come on board.The power company has also indicated that unit 7 was at an advanced stage and on course to start power generation on December 24 while the second unit will come on line in March next year.About 85 percent of the civil works at Kariba have been completed.It is hoped that the project would be finished within the budgeted total cost of $533 million, including development cost to be added to the $354 million cost of the engineering, procurement and construction contract awarded to Sino Hydro.
