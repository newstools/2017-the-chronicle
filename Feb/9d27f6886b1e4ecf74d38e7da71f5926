Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ATHLETICS officials have expressed shock at the poor level of event management exhibited by Imbizo District during the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) track and field inter-schools meet held at White City Stadium on Monday and Tuesday. The officials from the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) and its affiliate the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) said the amateurish management of the event showed the need for teachers from the district to attend Naaz and Bab coaching clinics held throughout the year.It was confusion all over from the medal presentation ceremonies, with athletes being given wrong medals only to be called back to the podium.Some guests officiating at the medals presentations were not escorted by ushers resulting in some of them crossing the track while a race was on.Some results had no times, while vertical and horizontal jumps also suffered the same fate in terms of measurements, which are key in athletics. This is worrying that at this level we still have people who can t grasp basic athletics rules and coaching skills; people who can t run such a small event of just 10 schools. What is sad about all this though is that none of the teachers from this district ever bother themselves to attend our courses as Bab and the result is this confusion, said a member of Bab.Imbizo District comprises some of Bulawayo s elite schools such as Christian Brothers College (CBC), Masiyepambili High and Eastview.Other schools that make up the district include Emsizini, Induna, Maranatha, Mncumbatha, Nketa, Tennyson Hlabangana and Emganwini.Another official said: We are just here to watch, but it s clearly not good for schools athletics in Bulawayo. People need to just swallow their pride and accept to be fed knowledge. I mean a track event is on and someone is busy on the phone or having a drink; how do you concentrate as a time keeper or receiver? We have not seen this in other districts, whether for Nash or Naph competitions, and Imbizo Naph is far organised than this. The Imbizo athletics meet was used to select a district team that will compete against four other districts, Mzilikazi, Bulawayo Central, Reigate, and Khami at an inter-district competition early next month.@skhumoyo2000
