Caroline NdlovuSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO businesswoman Caroline Ndlovu has been officially co-opted into the Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) executive committee in line with the Zifa constitution. Ndlovu, who runs a sports shop in the city, joins the executive committee led by Rosemary Kanonge, who is deputised by another Bulawayo businesswoman Samukeliso Silengane.Ndlovu automatically becomes a Zifa councillor and can now attend Zifa council meetings along with Silengane, Samukeliso Ndlovu and Barbra Chikosi, who are all members of the ZWSL executive committee.The four will attend Zifa council meetings according to Article 21 of the Zifa constitution.Kanonge is a Zifa executive committee member by virtue of her position as chairperson of women s football. I can confirm that Caroline Ndlovu has been co-opted into the women s football executive committee. This was after the realisation that we could not make up the required numbers in the last Zifa council meeting. We were then advised that we can actually co-opt someone into the committee, but the emphasis was that the person must be a woman. Caroline became the obvious choice because of her interest in football and I understand she also runs a sports shop in Bulawayo, among other things she does for and in football, said Kanonge.She said they wrote a letter to Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa informing him of their decision and choice. The president okayed the move, so Caroline becomes one of us now and we hope she will add value, not only to the committee, but to the development of women s football in Zimbabwe, Kanonge said. @skhumoyo2000
