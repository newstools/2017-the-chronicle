Taurai MangwiroOscar Rusenga in Triangle AS revealed by our Harare Bureau two weeks ago, Taurai Mangwiro has been unveiled as the new head coach of Triangle United. He has signed a two-year contract at the club.The 47-year-old former Harare City coach, who resigned as the technical director at Zifa last week, replaced David Mandigora to become Triangle s fifth coach in five years.Mangwiro is a holder of CAF A licence and a German international B licence and is also a CAF regional instructor. It feels good to be back practising and after being shown the exit at Harare City I ended up assuming duty at Zifa as technical director and when the opportunity arose at Triangle I felt I needed to come back since I feel I have unfinished business coaching and developing players. I still feel there is a lot I can do to help develop players in the country, yes, I was doing a bit in developing coaches but I feel I have more to do with development and training of the players, said Mangwiro.Club secretary Abraham Chinemaringa introduced the new technical team to the players at Gibbo. Taurai Mangwiro is assuming the head coach s role for this season going forward, Godfrey Tamirepi is coming as assistant coach while Innocent Chogugudza is our new goalkeeper s trainer and with this new technical team we are looking forward to a good season going forward, said Chinemaringa.Triangle had a difficult 2016 season under club president Kempton Gwamura and sources said they have since appointed a new club president, Adelaide Chikunguru, who is also the Tongaat Hulett Corporate Affairs and Communications Executive.Mangwiro also explained that the lure of the challenges of the Premiership convinced him to leave his post as the Zifa technical director.Zifa are set to name former Bosso gaffer Bongani Mafu as the technical director.
