The team is in Livingstone for our pre-season training camp and we will wrap it up with a tour to Bulawayo where we are going to play three games against Chicken Inn, Highlanders and Bantu Rovers. We will play Chicken Inn on Saturday (March 4), then Highlanders the following day and our last game will be against Bantu Rovers on Tuesday (March 7). Our coaches want to assess the team that they assembled and see if we re on the right path in preparing for the 2017 season which kicks off in three weeks time, said Manfunda.He said Power Dynamos who started their 2017 preparation in January will use the visit to create relations with Zimbabwean clubs. Obviously we want to develop relations with Zimbabwean teams as well as look at opportunities that might avail themselves. If the coaches spot some talent and recommend to the club, we will definitely make follow-ups and make effort to get those players. We re not closing doors in terms of scouting for talent, Manfunda said.Power Dynamos are coached by Dan Kabwe, who is assisted by former Railstars and Zimbabwe Saints coach Anderson Phiri.Power Dynamos are one of the best sides in Zambia and their visit to Bulawayo will present Highlanders, Chicken Inn and Rovers a chance to check their state of preparedness ahead of the 2017 season.Bosso returned from a five-day pre-season camp in Polokwane, South Africa, a fortnight ago where they played three training games.They drew 1-1 against First Division side Amagesi before losing 2-1 to Polokwane and being thumped 6-0 by Baroka.Having missed an opportunity to present their 2017 squad to their supporters at the weekend following cancellation of the ZNA Charity Shield semi-finals tie against FC Platinum because of a waterlogged Barbourfields Stadium, Bosso are likely to use the Power Dynamos game to parade their new signing, Rodrick Mutuma.Chicken Inn who beat Hwange 1-0 at the Colliery Stadium on Saturday will be hoping to build-up from that friendly match victory and beat Power Dynamos as they work on reclaiming the title they lost to Caps United last season.Youthful Bantu Rovers will get a real test of playing against the big boys when they face Power Dynamos.@ZililoR
