Mama Sandi, (Eunice Nomthandazo Moyo, the Bulawayo Metropolitan provincial affairs minister) and the entire parents from Bulawayo, this facility is yours, let s uplift it to international standards and maintain it. No one else will do that for us except us and our kids, said VP Mphoko.He applauded the Bulawayo City Council for revamping the facility presented to them by the Government as part of the legacy plan of the AUSC Region Five Games in preparation for the Cana event without which it would not have been approved as a Fina qualifying event for the World Swimming Championships which will be held in Budapest, Hungary in July this year. It is through passionate efforts of this nature and magnitude and collaborations with the Government that we can only see our sport particularly with aquatics growing in this country. It is my hope that all the athletes gathered here will perform to the best of their ability, said Vice President Mphoko.&nbsp;
