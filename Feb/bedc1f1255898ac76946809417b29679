Arsene WengerArsenal forward Lucas Perez has said he does not get the impression that Arsene Wenger will leave at the end of the season. Wenger, whose contract expires in the summer, is under increasing pressure after last week s Champions League humiliation at Bayern Munich.But Perez, who started and scored in Monday s 2-0 FA Cup win at non-league Sutton United, told Cadena Cope radio: After the result of the Champions League it s normal to get criticism. But he is not transmitting to us that he is going to leave. We don t know what is going through his head. He started the year with a lot of enthusiasm. Obviously we are down because of our result in Munich in the Champions League. Wenger, 67, said last Friday that he would make a decision on whether to remain with the Gunners in March or April but stressed that he intended to remain in coaching.The Frenchman has steered Arsenal to three Premier League titles and six FA Cups during his 21 years in North London. He will do what is best for him and for the club, Perez added. But he is calm. He has been here for many years and has a lot of experience. ESPNFC
