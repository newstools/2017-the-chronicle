Timson MoyoCynthia Dube, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo s Mzilikazi suburb allegedly deserted his wife of 12 years to cohabit with his late brother s wife. This came out at the maintenance court after Nomhlanga Mlalazi (35) filed an application against her husband Timson Moyo (38) seeking $210 for the upkeep of their two children.Moyo said he was in love with his late brother s wife and sees nothing wrong with that because she offers him better services compared to his wife.Ms Mlalazi said Moyo was an irresponsible man because he no longer looks after his children and spends most of his time with his late brother s wife. Your worship, my husband no longer cares for us because he is in love with his late brother s wife who is a business woman. The children are in arrears at school and l don t have money to pay their school fees, said Ms Moyo. Sometimes he can spend the whole month in Plumtree where his brother s wife resides. My children are no longer getting their father s love. I am suffering alone with them while their father is busy with her squandering the money that is meant for his children. In response, Moyo said his brother s wife was giving him better services compared to his wife. I am offering $100 for the upkeep of my children. I love my brother s wife and l don t think that there is any problem about that, he said.Bulawayo Magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya ordered Moyo to pay $210 for the upkeep of his children starting from this month end. If this woman was claiming more than $210 l was going to grant her application because you don t show respect. You also have to know that there is no pleasure without responsibility, said Mr Tashaya. @cynthiamthembo1&nbsp;
