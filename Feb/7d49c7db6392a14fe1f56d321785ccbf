Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent VALENTINE S is just two weeks away from today and already many businesses want to cash in on the day with a theme of intimacy being their thrust this year. Considering that some would be recovering from the dreaded January disease, some like 3D events want to do things differently from previous years.Cupid s Cube is what they are running with, a concept where couples will party the night away under the protection of an inflatable cube tent that will be erected at Hartsfield Tshisanyama on February 11. It s a party where couples will enjoy in style with each other. The theme is red, white and black and people are encouraged to dress like that for the party, said Mduduzi Mdlongwa one of the organisers. We wanted to hold something different, exciting and unique that people can remember in the future. He said only 300 tickets for the special show are on sale at the venue at $15 for couples and $10 for singles. Women will be given a complimentary rose and chocolate. The Cube can only carry 300 people so the tickets are limited. We can t take any more than that because we don t want to spoil the mood with an overcrowded venue, said Mdlongwa.On the night DJ T Bass from Harare will be part of the entertainment at the venue.
