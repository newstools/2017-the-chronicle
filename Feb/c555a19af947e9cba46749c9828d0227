Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter AN-86-YEAR-OLD granny who lived alone in Tsholotsho has died due to serious burns after a candle fell and ignited an inferno as she slept. Mavis Ndebele of Dibutibu Village under Chief Mathuphula was buried at the weekend after succumbing to burns at Mpilo Central Hospital where she was transferred to from Tsholotsho District Hospital following the incident.Chief Mathuphula said the granny went through a painful death and regretted that her family had left her to live alone in old age.The chief said the old woman didn t deserve to die in such a manner. The loss of uGogo koNdebele is a terrible incident. I urge the community never to leave vulnerable people, the elderly and children alone at home. These people need special care and monitoring at all times. This special group needs loving family members to look after them, cook and assist them whenever help is needed and most of all they need love and care. It is sad to find an 86-year-old staying by herself, cooking for herself and doing all those chores by herself. Let s show love to our elders and make sure they are well taken care of, said Chief Mathuphula. We all feel that perhaps it s old age which made her fail to save herself. It s such a painful way to die. Ward 4 Councillor Bigi Nyoni said it was unfortunate that by the time Gogo MaNdebele s son Milos noticed the fire, it was already too late to save her. Her son Milos Ndebele lives with his family at a home next to his mother s. He saw a fire emanating from his mother s home at around 6PM on Tuesday.UGogo uMaNdebele had already retired to bed, having forgotten to blow out the candle. The candle allegedly fell and her blankets caught fire and spread through her bedroom hut, he said.@winnie_masara
