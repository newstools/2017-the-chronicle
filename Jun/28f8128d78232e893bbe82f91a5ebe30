Tsholotsho flood victims relocate to their new standsAndile Tshuma/ Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporters THE relocation of more than 800 families that were affected by floods in Tsholotsho district, Matabeleland North province, started yesterday. The district was one of the hardest hit by Cyclone Dineo induced floods last February and some of the marooned families had to be airlifted to Sipepa Hospital where Government had established a transit camp.The District Administrator Mrs Gladys Zizhou said the families were being moved to their new area so that they could start building their new homes. Instead of them continuing to be congested at the transit camp, we decided to move them to their new stands so that they could assist in the building of their new homes. The families will move with their tents which they will continue to use until the completion of their houses, she said.Mrs Zizhou however said some of the school children will remain at the camp due to logistical challenges.More than 300 stands have been pegged at Tshino and Sawudweni villages in Ward Six of Tsholotsho North.Mrs Zizhou said they have so far completed the construction of 300 toilets and the District Development Fund (DDF) has also started drilling boreholes at the new sites. So far we ve completed the construction of 164 toilets at Tshino and 136 at Sawudweni, she said.Mrs Zizhou said the families were excited to move to the new areas to build permanent homes.She appealed to companies, organisations and individuals to assist with building materials to enable families to build houses as well as stationery for pupils. Right now we are appealing to well-wishers to assist us with building materials. We are in dire need of bricks and cement, said Mrs Zizhou.Recently, Botswana donated building material comprising of 1 500 roofing sheets, 200 door frames and gauge wire to the families.Affected villages include Mahlosi, Mahlaba, Thamuhla, Mbamba, Mele, Lutshome, Maphili and Mbanyana.Government has pledged to build a three-roomed house, a separate kitchen hut and a toilet for each of the affected households.A secondary school, clinic and a police base are also expected to be constructed to service the relocated villagers.@andile_tshuma@winnie-masara
