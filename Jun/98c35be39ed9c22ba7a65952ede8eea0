Oscar Rusenga in Triangle Triangle 1-0 ZPC Kariba TRIANGLE recorded an important victory at home after they laboured to this narrow win over ZPC Kariba in Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Gibbo yesterday.The match started on a slow note with both teams failing to string meaningful passes as they struggled to create any goal scoring chances.The home side, however, opened the scoring in the 23rd minute through Dzingai Chirambamuriwo after a well worked counter-attack.Pint-sized captain Nhamo Lameck was the architect of this goal as his pass was well utilised by former Mufakose Secondary School High pupil Chirambamuriwo who pushed his effort from an acute angle past Tendai Hove. I think we played very well but we played to deep in the first half, we didn t create a single shot at goal in the first half but we improved in the second half and we must thank our goalkeeper Tendai Hove for keeping us in the game but we must congratulate Triangle for taking their chance, said ZPC Kariba team manager Oliver Mataba who was standing in for head coach Sunday Chidzambwa who is away with the national team for Cosafa Castle Cup in South Africa.It was sweet victory for Triangle assistant coach Godfrey Tamirepi against his former side. Sweet victory indeed against my former side, ZPC Kariba, after a frustrating loss away from home against Harare City. We just hope the victory will give us the much-needed confidence going into the Tsholotsho match as we search for our first consecutive victories in the season, said Tamirepi.
