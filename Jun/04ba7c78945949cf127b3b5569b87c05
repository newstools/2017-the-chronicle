Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter MORE than 300 athletes are set to compete in the 2017 Southern Region Senior Athletics Championships to be held at the National Sports Stadium today and tomorrow. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) president Tendai Tagara said all is set for the competition. We were told about this tournament two years back so we have tried to save as much as we can as an association and that enabled us to have a foundation to kick start the event. We have also asked the Government to chip in with food and accommodation. Financially the economy is not doing well but we are happy with the support that we have received so far from the Government, said Tagara.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe will be represented by a 50-member team comprising 20 ladies and 30 men.National team head coach Lismati Phakamile said the team is ready for the challenge.
