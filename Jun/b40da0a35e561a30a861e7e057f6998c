Dr David ParirenyatwaPaidamoyo Chipunza, Harare Bureau Government does not anticipate major price increases on fortified food as the cost of ingredients used during the process are not significant to influence any changes, a Cabinet Minister has said. Food fortification is the process of adding nutrients such as vitamins and minerals to food to prevent nutritional deficiencies.Government has made it mandatory that food processors fortify food; mealie meal, cooking oil, flour and sugar with effect from July 1.Health and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa said no major price increases were anticipated once food fortification becomes mandatory.In an interview on the impact of the new Government policy, which becomes effective on July 1, 2017, Dr Parirenyatwa said the cost of fortification ranged from $3.50 to $4.50 per tonne, which translated to about 0.05c per kg of mealie meal. Cost of food fortification is miniscule, ranging from $3.50 to $4.50 per tonne or just about $0.05c per 10 kg of mealie meal, which is minimal, said Dr Parirenyatwa.He said while some manufacturers such as those in the cooking oil and sugar industries have already started fortifying their products, no major price increases have so far been noted. Most of the manufacturers have responded positively and are ready to comply since there had been extensive consultations by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, said Dr Parirenyatwa.A snap survey by The Herald in some supermarkets in the Central Business District (CBD) on products that have since been fortified, bore evidence to the fact that no major price increases have been effected.However, prices for other commodities had gone up slightly.A 2 litre bottle of fortified Zim Gold cooking oil is going for $2.85 while Huletts brown sugar cost $1,95 and $1.79 for white sugar. Fortified Sunrise 2kg flour is going for $1,85, Snow White $2,39 and Self Raising $1,65.A 10 kg of Pearlenta mealie meal is going for $7,65, Probrands $7,15, Roller Meal $6,55 and Chibataura $5.09. These prices have not changed. They were like that even before fortification unless the producers are going to increase after July 1, but still prices for some commodities, which are not even on the fortification list have already gone up. For example, we used to sell Lifebuoy soap for 99c, but it now costs $1.35 a tablet, said a merchandiser from one of the supermarkets in the CBD.Government, through Statutory Instrument 120 of 2017, recently made it mandatory for cooking oil, sugar, mealie meal and flour producers to fortify their products with effect from July 1, 2017. Some producers have already indicated their readiness to comply with the new law, others are already fortifying yet some sectors of industry are still seeking a reversal of the new policy arguing that they were not yet ready for fortification.Government has, however, maintained that it was not going to rescind its decision to make fortification for the four products mandatory come July 1, 2017, urging those that have not yet complied to apply for a waiver for a period of time until they are compliant.
