Samukeliso SilenganeSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League is mulling dividing its league into two regional competitions to save on operational costs and enhance the quality of the game. Following a suggestion by the Zimbabwe Women s Football leadership that there be a single league, the national league has been increased to 24 teams from 12 last season.Zimbabwe Women s Football vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane said they had been overwhelmed by the positive response and suggestions have been raised to reduce the number of teams to maintain quality by splitting the league into the Northern and Southern regions. We are mulling having two leagues, but we are yet to work on the modalities because we feel 24 teams is too large a number; the competition might be compromised as well, said Silengane.Bulawayo teams have been struggling in the league so far and have suffered massive defeats in matches played to date. The city has six teams after Highlanders Royals came on board, having initially dragged their feet largely due to certain individuals that wanted to monopolise the team.The other city clubs are Street Set, Inline, Hearts of Oak, New Orleans and Borrow Jets.Meanwhile, the Bulawayo teams have questioned the rationale of playing their games at one venue instead of being allowed to use their home grounds.This has resulted in them losing their support base.The teams have been using the Barbourfields Stadium outside grounds for their games. We understand it could be to do with grounds, but we have seen worse fields than those that we have here in Bulawayo. These girls also need to play in front of their fans for that moral support and besides, we are used to our home grounds, said one club executive.Most Bulawayo teams command a decent following at their home matches.Zimbabwe Women Soccer League teamsHearts of Oak, ZRP Queens, Masvingo Queens, Black Rhinos Queens, Oaklands, Wee Ramms, ZRP Morris, MSU Queens, Herentals, ZRP Harare, Highlanders Royals, Zvishavane Pirates, Mwenezana Queens, Faithdrive, Correctional Queens, Mufakose Queens, Cyclone Stars, Conjuit Soccer Academy Borrow Jets, Inline Academy, New Orleans, Blue Swallows, Street Set, Chipembere.@skhumoyo2000
