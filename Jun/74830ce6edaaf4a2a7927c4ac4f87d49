Abel XavierSikhumbuzo Moyo in Sun City, South Africa MOZAMBIQUE S victory over Group B minnows Seychelles on Wednesday night in the Cosafa Castle Cup threw the group wide open heading into today s final group matches that will be played simultaneously at Moruleng Stadium and Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace. Zimbabwe take on Seychelles at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace, while Mozambique clash against Madagascar. Both games kick-off at 5PM.The Warriors lead the group with four points by virtue of a superior goal difference over Madagascar after the two countries drew nil-all on Wednesday, while Mozambique have three points following their 2-1 win over Seychelles on the same day.A win for Mozambique will take their points tally to six and see them taking on Swaziland in the quarter-finals on Sunday if the Warriors draw or fall to Seychelles. For Madagascar they need to beat Mozambique by at least four goals with the Mambas not replying and hope that Zimbabwe either lose or win by a single goal margin against Seychelles.The win on Wednesday gave Mozambique coach Abel Xavier a glimmer of hope of scrapping through to the quarter-finals and will have everything to fight for this evening.Madagascar coach Auguste Arsene Welgor Raux, whose side have inept Botswana referee Joshua Bondo to thank for the 0-0 draw against Zimbabwe on Wednesday, knows that the task ahead is not easy. We now need to score as many goals as possible against Mozambique, but it will never be easy, that we know, he said in a post-match interview on Wednesday evening.The Warriors need to remain focused and avoid putting themselves under unnecessary pressure, especially against a side that has managed just a single goal in this tournament and have historically struggled against them.The two nations have met seven times in different competitions and the Warriors have managed five wins, including two 5-0 wins, the last coming last year in the Cosafa tournament in Namibia.Group B winners will clash with Swaziland on Sunday for a berth in the semi-finals where the winner between Namibia and Lesotho awaits for the right to the final on June 9.The Warriors are in the running for a record fifth Cosafa Castle Cup win and morale is still high in camp despite Wednesday s set back.
