Running uphill was quite easy for me and I think it helped me a lot to keep abreast with the leading pack. With 2km to go, I just saw myself making a surge and I held on until the finish line, said Nyamutsa.Chikanga (20) was happy to win at the first attempt and to complete the race in 35 minutes.Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairman Manuel Mpofu said the race was a great success as participants increased by close to half of those that took part last year. In 2015 we had 520 people competing and the figure rose to 730 last year and we are happy that this year there were 1 065, a target we had set ourselves last year, said Mpofu. We are also glad to announce that our sponsors agreed to turn the event into a half-marathon and next year we are going to have a 21km race, which will hopefully help us attract more athletes, he Mpofu.
