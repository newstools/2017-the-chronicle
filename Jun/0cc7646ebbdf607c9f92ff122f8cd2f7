Lindani NyathiThandeka Moyo, Health Reporter A FAMILY from Njube suburb in Bulawayo is appealing to members of the public to help secure funds for blood and an operation for one of its sons who developed a tumour after his tooth was extracted. Lindani Nyathi (23) is admitted at Mpilo Central Hospital and has been referred to Harare for an operation.Nyathi s mother Mrs Sitshengisiwe Dliwayo told The Chronicle that the family has only managed to raise money for two pints of blood. My son was working in South Africa when one of his teeth was removed. Afterwards he started complaining of pain and developed a growth on his jaw which has worsened with each passing day, said Mrs Dliwayo. The situation got worse and he had to come back home and we took him to Mpilo. We were told that he has a tumour on his jaw which needs to be cut and that can only be done at Parirenyatwa. She said the family was struggling to raise the funds for the operation. They also said his system is weak and he needs six pints of blood. We only managed to raise money for two pints and we desperately need the remainder before he can be operated. He is in pain and can no longer eat as both his mouth and throat are now blocked, Mrs Dliwayo said. We are not yet sure of the total cost of the operation but it may cost us $800. We stay at A317 Njube and I can be contacted on +263717243401. Those who may wish to send us money through Eco Cash may use +263783567681 registered in Elliot Chokwara s name. @thamamoe
