Omega SibandaAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress (Orap) has partnered Zifa to conduct a week long grassroots football coaching course in the Umzingwane district of Matabeleland South. The course, which is funded by the United States Africa Children s Fellowship (USAFC), Supa Soccer and Round Star Foundation, started on Sunday and ends on Friday.Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda, Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede, Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) vice-chairperson Samkeliso Silengane and Zifa Bulawayo Province training and development administrator Tumediso Mokoena Ndlovu were in attendance.Sibanda said they are happy to see non-governmental organisations (NGOs) partnering the football body in developing soccer at the grassroots level. This (coaching course) is a special emphasis on grassroots development as per Fifa requirements and as Zifa we are grateful to have experts from United States facilitating the programme. It s also a good thing to see organisations like Orap playing such an important role as far as football development is concerned, said Sibanda.He said there is no future for football without putting in place proper measures to scout for talent early. The future of football is with these children and that is where our main focus must be. We are looking at building future football stars and I think it must be mandatory that one is well-versed with grassroots coaching before they can get a Level One certificate, said Sibanda.In March this year, Zifa held a similar grassroots coaching course in Masvingo, which was facilitated by Fifa instructor Ulric Mathiot.The major thrust of grassroots football is to take the game to all children between the ages of six and 12 years, ensuring that they are nurtured in the best possible ways through the guidance of coach educators to become not only professional footballers, but also good citizens.The grassroots courses dovetail with the Ministry of Sport and Recreation s project that target to establish at least 8 000 football clubs countrywide.@khumzallen
