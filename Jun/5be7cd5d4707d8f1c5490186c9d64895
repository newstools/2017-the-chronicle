Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter ZIMBABWE remains a favourable investment destination as it still has basic infrastructure to support business growth, a visiting Botswana businessman has said. Founder and owner of Botswana-based Power Play Consultancy, Mr Wilfred Mpai, who was in Bulawayo this week, expressed willingness to partner local companies especially in Bulawayo to increase production and job opportunities. There are factories that are standing empty and they need to be brought to life to cater for the unemployed. Zimbabwe has got a foundation only if you get the right funders who will invest here and the companies will be back on their feet and the economy will be moving forward, said Mr Mpai.He applauded the country for its hospitality standards saying its people were hard workers who render good service to clients. As Power Play we are willing to partner local companies in Bulawayo to try and build the industry. We need to work with different companies so that both countries benefit at the end of the day. For the local industry to be back on its feet it needs a collective approach from different companies to work together and bring the best out of all the parties, said Mr Mpai who spoke on the side lines of the Fortwell Wholesale customer appreciation cocktail party in the city.He said Zimbabwe needs more help in terms of capacitating companies, which would open more avenues for growth.
