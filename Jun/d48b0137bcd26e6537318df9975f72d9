Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Poultry Farmers Association (ZPFA) says the high cost of stockfeed in Matabeleland has seen chicken price in the region remaining relatively high averaging between $3.50 a kilogramme and $4. ZPFA chairman Retired Colonel George Nare said in areas such as Harare, chicken price averaged $2.70 a kilogramme. High cost of stockfeed is the biggest challenge we are facing as poultry farmers in Matabeleland region. It costs between $27 and $29 per 50kg of stockfeed when buying directly from stockfeed manufacturers and the price is even higher when buying from retailers, he said. Unlike in other parts of Zimbabwe, Matabeleland receives erratic rains making it unfit for crop production. As a result, stockfeed manufacturers in the region have to buy the maize and soya beans from other parts of the country such as Mashonaland. Rtd Col Nare said they expected the prices of stockfeed to drop following this year s bumper harvest. We are pinning our hopes on the bumper harvest expected this year, he said.@okazunga
