Cristiano RonaldoCRISTIANO RONALDO said that his numbers don t lie after his double helped Zinedine Zidane s Real Madrid side beat Juventus 4-1 in Cardiff. A goal in each half took the Portuguese to 105 Champions League strikes as Real became the first side since AC Milan in 1990 to win back-to-back cups. This is one of the best moments of my career but it seems I am able to say that every year, he said. People won t be able to criticise me because the numbers don t lie. Juventus were on top for large periods of an entertaining and open first 45 minutes, as Ronaldo s opener was cancelled out by Mario Mandzukic s superb overhead kick.But Real were dominant after the break as efforts from Casemiro, Ronaldo again, and Marco Asensio sealed a 12th European Cup win and a third in four seasons.Ronaldo has now scored at least twice as many Champions League goals as any other player in the quarter-finals (20), semi-finals (13) and finals (4).He has won the Champions League on four occasions and has now scored 11 more goals in the competition than Barcelona s Lionel Messi &#8211; his nearest challenger.
