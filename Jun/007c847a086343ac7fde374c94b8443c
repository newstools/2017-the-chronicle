Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ORGANISERS of the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAAs) are searching for presenters for the inaugural awards ceremony taking place at the Large City Hall next Friday. Raisedon Baya, one of the members of the BAAs steering team, said they wanted to spice up the event by bringing in new faces who are not necessarily from the arts industry. BAAs are looking for a few young vibrant achievers in any field who are below 35 years to present the awards. We need about five people who are not necessarily in the arts industry to present the awards in 38 categories. They must stay or work in Bulawayo. He said some names had been brought forward and they were still deliberating on giving them the task adding that the search for presenters was also a way to market the awards. This is part of our many ways to spread the word to other people in the city and across the country that Bulawayo is hosting its first arts awards ceremony. Just like the voting process which has created much hype, we hope the search for presenters will also create a similar hype, the more people know about the awards, the better. Baya said MCs of the night had already been secured although they will only be revealed this Friday.On their preparedness to host the awards ceremony, the organiser said although they had received a considerable amount of sponsorship, they could still do with some more support. There are about 10 categories that still don t have sponsorship, the rest have people who promised to sponsor. However, we appeal to everyone, not only companies, but also individuals to come forward and sponsor any category of their choice so as to promote arts in the city.
