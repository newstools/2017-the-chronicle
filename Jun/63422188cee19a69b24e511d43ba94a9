Dube is the league s joint top scorer with Mungombe on six goals. Adrian Banana ofBulawayo Chiefs, Bosso 90 s Muziwakhe Dlamini and Ngulube are all tied on five goals. Indlovu Iyanyathela s pair of Alfred Mehlomakhulu and Collins Tshuma and Anesu Nyathi of Talen Vision have each scored four goals.Nokel Security director Kenneth Mhlophe said he is happy players from newly promoted sides are leading the scorers charts. This is good for the game because in the past, we ve seen the award going to players from teams chasing the championship, but this time around it seems new teams want to own the award. We also want to see players from out of Bulawayo teams winning the award because the essence of this accolade is to encourage players to be clinical in front of goal, said Mhlophe. @ZililoR
