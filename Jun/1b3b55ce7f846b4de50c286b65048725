Hoping to continue with the same momentum on Sunday, Madlela Skhobokhobo will share the stage with Khaya Arts Dance Group with DJs Sweeto, Quinn, Sheriff, Stones and Phibz on the decks.Said Umqombothi resident DJ Sweeto: Madlela is a very popular musician and he s the man of the moment especially in the high density areas. His song Ngamnanka is always being requested by our patrons so we decided to host him live. He said the show would be on Sunday because Madlela was booked all throughout the weekend. Madlela is a busy man and has a lot of bookings. We d initially wanted him to perform on Friday or Saturday but he was fully booked on both days, said DJ Sweeto.
