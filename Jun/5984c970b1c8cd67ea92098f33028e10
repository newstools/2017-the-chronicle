Nation DubeTobias Mandoreba in Hwange Hwange 2 &#8211; 0 Shabanie Mine HWANGE registered their first home win in the 2017 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League campaign when they dismissed Shabanie Mine in a pulsating encounter at the Colliery Stadium yesterday.The win also marked the first time the coal miners scored a goal on home turf.A well taken spot kick by the match s outstanding player Justine Kaunda in the 34th minute and a second by substitute Tendai Mate in the 73th minute brought jubilation to the home fans when referee Bekezela Makeka blew to end the match.Mate s cushion goal in his debut match took him just eight minutes to score in Hwange colours and that quickly endeared him to the Chipangano faithful.Mate was playing for ZRP Hwange in the First Division last season and came on for Morestuf Ncube in the 65th minute.His goal will be remembered for a long time as it calmed the Hwange nerves at a time determined Shabanie were threatening to level matters.The asbestos miners have themselves to blame for going back to Zvishavane empty-handed due to their wastefulness in front of goal.In the ninth minute, Trevor Mavhunga s curling volley whistled past the Hwange goalkeeper Taimon Mvula s right upright, with the entire bench already celebrating.Hwange s first real raid on the Shabanie goal came in the 18th minute when striker Gilbert Zulu s rasping shot hit the underside of the crossbar and back into play onto the path of Ncube, who headed over with a yawning net in front of him.Hwange kept pressing and were awarded a penalty in the 34th minute after defender Admire Dzumbunu was adjudged to have handled Ncube s goal bound effort.The coalminers started the second half in the same pressing fashion and could have doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when Kaunda s flashing header off a delicate cross from speedy midfielder Shepherd Gadzikwa was brilliantly tipped over the bar by Shabanie keeper, Samuel Mafukidze.Mate was then introduced in the 65th minute and he immediately harassed the Shabanie rear-guard with his clever runs.In the 73rd minute, Mate latched onto a pass from Kaunda and outpaced the Shabanie defenders before slotting home past the advancing Mafukidze.Hwange coach, Nation Dube was over the moon after the game. I am a happy and can afford a long sleep today. Things are shaping up in the company as a whole and I am happy the boys responded with a memorable team effort. It gives encouragement going forward, said Dube.Shabanie coach Takesure Chiragwi bemoaned his team s wasted Chances. In football you get punished if you don t take your chances as we were supposed to blow Hwange away in the opening half. Penalties are part of the game, but I think the Hwange one was a bit soft. No excuses though, as we have to translate our good play into wins, Chiragwi said.Teams Hwange: T Mvula; C Phiri; G Ndlovu; O Moyo; M Mekiwa; A Tshuma; S Gadzikwa; O Lungu ( A Banda 80th min); J Kaunda; M Ncube (T Ncube 65th min); G ZuluShabanie Mine: S Mafukidze; J Nyabinde; W Mapfumo; N Mpofu; A Dzumbunu; T Mavhunga; C Dhuwa; W Taderera (F Muza 70th min); D Chivandire; E Phiri( T Chigede 50th min); B Mtigo (T Chimoyo 80th min).@tobymandox
