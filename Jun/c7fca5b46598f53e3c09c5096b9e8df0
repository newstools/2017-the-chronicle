Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIFA says it has started disbursing transport money to Zimbabwe Women s Super League (ZWSL) teams as part of empowering women. Zifa pledged to sponsor the women s teams with uniforms, transport and referees fees upon announcing the return of the league after a four-year absence.ZWSL chairperson Rosemary Kanonge said they had finished processing paper work and teams should expect their money anytime. We have just finalised doing the paperwork after a request was sent to the football body (Zifa) and very soon teams will start receiving their monies as promised. We want to express our gratitude to Zifa for helping us because as a league we had nothing. This step by the association will surely go a long way in developing women s soccer in the country, said Kanonge.Zifa s thrust to have a smooth running and competitive league is premised on creating a strong national team ahead of the 2017 Council of Southern African Football Associations (Cosafa) Women s Championship to be held in Bulawayo in September featuring eight countries.The ZWSL is made up of 14 teams, Hearts of Oak, New Orleans, Street Set, Mufakose Queens, Borrow Street Jets, Mwenezana Queens, Conduit Academy, Blue Swallows, Cyclone Stars, Masvingo Queens, Inline Academy, Faith Drive Queens, Chipembere Queens and Zvishavane Pirates.The league is chaired by Kanonge, who is deputised by Bulawayo businesswoman Samkeliso Silengane. Other members of the executive committee include Samkeliso Ndhlovu, Barbra Chikosi, Caroline Ndlovu and Luckmore Marufu.ZWSL Saturday FixturesMasvingo Queens v Mufakose Queens (Mucheke Stadium), Hearts of Oak v Mwenezana Queens (Barbourfields Stadium), Borrow Jets v Correctional Queens (Luveve Stadium), Conduit Academy v Chipembere Queens (Madhodha Stadium), Faith Drive Queens v Inline Academy (Nyamuhuru High School), Cyclone Stars v New Orleans (Harare High School), Zvishavane Pirates v ZRP Harare FC (Kandondo Stadium), Street Set v Blue Swallows (Barbourfields Stadium). @khumzallen.
