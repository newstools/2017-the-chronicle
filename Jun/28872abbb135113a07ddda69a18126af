Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Highlanders and Lancashire Steel striker Makreza Navaya has died. He was 35.Navaya passed away at Isolation Hospital in Mtapa, Gweru, in the early hours of yesterday after a short illness.Navaya s sister, Anna Navaya, confirmed the death and said burial arrangements would be announced soon. My brother passed away this (yesterday) morning. He had been very sick and it s a pity he died young while trying to rebuild his life, said the grief stricken Anna.Navaya burst onto the local football scene as a pupil at Ascot High School in 1999 while turning out for Zifa Midlands Division Two side United Bottlers, who were then under the tutelage of former Arcadia dribbling wizard Mike Abrahams.Bongani Mafu, who was coaching Zimbabwe Saints, took him to Chikwata before then Highlanders coach Eddie May lured him to Bosso.However, a wrangle for the player between Zimbabwe Saints and Bosso derailed his career in 2000 and he spent the entire 2001 season on the sidelines.He then played for Highlanders in 2002 and partnered the late Adam Ndlovu in the Caf Champions League.He spent two seasons with the Bulawayo giants before being offloaded to Lancashire Steel in 2004 where he played alongside Luke Petros-Jukulile, Stephen Sande and Jacob Muzokomba, among others.Navaya spent only one season at Lancashire before moving to Ziscosteel. He later moved to the lower divisions before hanging his boots.Mourners are gathered at Number 4 Section 5, Mtapa Surbub. He is survived by two sons.@lavuzigara1
