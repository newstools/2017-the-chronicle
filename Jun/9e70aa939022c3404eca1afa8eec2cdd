Makina (48) died at Mpilo Hospital on Saturday after a short illness.Sports personalities who included former Highlanders chief executive officer Ndumiso Gumede, Highlanders goalkeepers coach Cosmas Tsano Zulu, officials from the Sports and Recreation Commission as well as journalists, were there to bid Makina farewell.Ex-ZBC producer Lee Mangena spoke highly of Makina. Words alone can t describe how I feel about losing a colleague and a brother. I first knew Makina in the 1990s when he was a DJ at Radio Three (now Power FM). He was known as Tarzan Tee and later on we worked together at SFM where he presented a Sunday sport programme called BP Check. After leaving ZBC last year, we reunited at Skyz Metro FM where we worked together on the Drive Time Sports Show. This was his show; he had great love for sport and Bulawayo, said Mangena.Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association president Eddie Chivero said Makina was an avid sport lover and his death had robbed the nation of a great sports caster . On behalf of ZNSSA and other sports code supporters, we will miss the informative and provocative debates that Makina brought up. He was a gentleman, who loved sport and his job, Chivero said.Dave Simba, a sports commentator with ZBC, described Makina as a selfless, humble man of few words who covered sport across the country.He said Makina had great interpersonal skills that made it easy for him to interact with people.Makina is survived by three children, two girls and a boy.
