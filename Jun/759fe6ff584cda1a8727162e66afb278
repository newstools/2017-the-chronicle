The three men took $27 from their victim.Victor Raja (19), Panashe Blessing Ncube (19) of Zimuto Camp and Kudzai Musaye (23) of Mucheke suburb pleaded not guilty to robbing Mr Mathias Tauyanarwo of Mucheke suburb.Masvingo regional magistrate Mrs Dambudzo Malunga, however, convicted the trio due to overwhelming evidence.She sentenced each of them to 10 years in prison.Raja and Ncube will serve an effective seven years in prison after Mrs Malunga suspended three years on condition of good behaviour.Musaye who is the oldest will, however, serve an effective 10 years as nothing was suspended.Delivering sentence Mrs Malunga said all the three are former convicts of unlawful entry and theft.She said the trio were unrepentant hence deterrent sentences were called for.For the State Ms Shamiso Masokovere said sometime this month, the accused hired a taxi from Ritz Night Club in the central Business District heading to Mucheke suburb.She said when they were near the Stadium, Ncube pretended to be a police officer and asked Tauyanarwo if he had authority to pirate.The court heard that Ncube produced a pair of handcuffs telling Tauyanarwo that he was under arrest for flouting the Road Traffic Act.Raja and Musaye stripped Tauyanarwo naked and also took away $27 from his wallet.Ncube drove back to Ritz Night Club where he parked the vehicle outside with Tauyanarwo in the car while his accomplices got into the night club to buy beer.The court heard Tauyanarwo managed to escape.He rushed to Masvingo Central Police where he reported the matter and a manhunt was launched.Ncube drove towards Masvingo-Harare road but was involved in an accident.Police swiftly reacted to the report and found the car near the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) offices.All the three were arrested the same day. &#8211; @walterbmswazie3
