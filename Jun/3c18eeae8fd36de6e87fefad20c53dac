Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CLUBS who have been dominating in the Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) have on paper what look like relatively easy assignments when action resumes this weekend. Leaders Tongogara will be hoping to turn things around following their 0 1 loss to Vumbachikwe when they take on Silo United who are third from bottom.MSU make their third trip to Gwanda for a date with log anchors Gwanda United with the hope of collecting maximum points following a 0 1 loss to ZPC Munyati last weekend.In their last two trips to the Matabeleland South capital, Themba Chingwena s charges have come back with four points after drawing 2 2 against ZRP Gwanda before overcoming Blanket Mine 2 1.However, Shurugwi based Nichrut have a tricky encounter when they take on FC Platinum Under 19 today at Peak Mine Stadium.The young platinum miners have been enjoying a purple patch recently winning their last two matches with their last being a 5 1 thumping of Kwekwe Stars.John Nyikadzino, the Nichrut coach believes his charges are up to the challenge. It s going to be a difficult match for us if you consider that they have been playing well recently. However, we are a club who have their own targets and we are going to make sure that we come up with a result, said the former Chapungu gaffer.Elsewhere, second placed ZPC Munyati s unbeaten run will also be under stern test when they take on Chrome Stars at home.The power generators are the only side not to have tasted defeat so far this season and coach Isaac Nyabvure conceded the chrome miners are tricky customers but said he wants to maintain the fine run. Chrome Stars has a lot of youngsters with potential and it is going to be a tough match for us. Being a derby makes it all difficult and like what we did against MSU we have to take our chances, said the former Lancashire Steel midfielder.FixturesToday: Makusha vs ZRP Gwanda (Makusha), Gwanda United vs MSU (Pelandaba), Kwekwe Stars vs Telone (Mbizo), Nichrut vs FC Platinum (Peak Mine), Tongogara vs Silo United (Battlefields), Border Strikers vs Vumbachikwe (Dulibadzimu), Black Eagles vs Whawha (Simbi) @lavuzigara1
