The show, a family event, will start at 3PM and end at 6PM to give Macheso time to travel to Vic Falls where he has another show on Saturday evening, said event organiser, Alois Sungano Sikuka.The 24-year-old show organiser said he was hosting Macheso as a way of thanking his community for raising him. I grew up in the Jambezi village and as a way of thanking my community for their guidance, I decided to bring one of their favourite musicians so that we can celebrate in style, said Sikuka.He said when he was young he used to go to Jambezi Centre during holidays such as Christmas to enjoy Macheso s music. When we were young, we used to go to the shopping centre just to listen to Macheso s music during holidays, he said.
