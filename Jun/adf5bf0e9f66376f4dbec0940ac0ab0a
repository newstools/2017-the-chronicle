We are very grateful as Mazvihwa community. We would want Murowa to also do a pilot ICT project at Baradzanwa Primary School now that we have electricity. Murowa has always been supportive of our community. The mine gave us small grain as food supplement as well as seed. Our neighbouring communities such as Masunda have also received seed and food supplements from Murowa, he said.
