The Pro50 champions quartet of veteran Keith Dabengwa, Tafara Mupariwa, Luke Jongwe and Mbekezeli Mabuza will play summer cricket in the UK and are expected in time for the start of the domestic 2017/18 season in September.Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket chairman Vumi Moyo confirmed that the four players would be active during Zimbabwe s off-season and believes the experience they will get from playing in the UK will improve their performances.Moyo said Mupariwa (21), a wicketkeeper-batsman, is playing for the UK-based academy run by Zimbabwe Cricket convenor of selectors Tatenda Taibu. This time around we ve given leave to Dabengwa, Mupariwa, Jongwe and Mabuza to play cricket in the UK during our off-season. This will help them keep in shape so that when the 2017/18 season resumes, they are sharp. Save for Mupariwa, who is at Taibu s academy, the other guys are playing club cricket, said Moyo.Dabengwa (36) is in Scotland and indications are that he is already preparing for life after playing.Moyo said the all-rounder has been pursuing coaching lessons in Europe.Scotland has become Dabengwa s second home, as the cricketer has played for Lymington Cricket Club.
