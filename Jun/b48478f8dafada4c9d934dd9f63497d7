Joseph RegoSports Reporter HEATH Streak International has twinned with Sunrise Sports Club to set up a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility in Harare. Heath Streak International was set up by former bowling speedster and national cricket coach Heath Streak and his partner Joseph Rego, chief executive officer of the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy.The partnership with Sunrise Sports Club is expected to help develop attractive facilities required to establish a fully-fledged international training centre.Sharadkumar Patel, chairman of Sunrise Sports Club, said members could now look forward to a club with well established sporting and recreational facilities.Heath Streak International will work to identify, nurture and groom young cricket talent that can graduate to the international stage in five years.Rego said they hoped to turn the club into an international cricket facility suitable for hosting international matches.In the first stage of development, the academy is looking at refurbishing the cricket field to international standards and focusing on forming four age group teams, Colts, Under-13, Under-14 and Under-16 teams, which will represent Sunrise Sports Club in professional tournaments and leagues under the guidance of former and current international cricketers, with professional coaches providing leadership, direction and quality programmes to develop the game at the grassroots level. The aim is to produce young cricket stars. We are very passionate about the sport and our aim is to ensure that our talented cricketers have the very best opportunities and a first class future, which will help Zimbabwe regain its past sporting glory, said Rego.The Heath Streak International will also introduce their flagship brand My Vision, My Dream , a popular community development sports project set to revolutionise sport development in the country. My Vision, My Dream will help transform the lives of hundreds of talented kids hailing from underprivileged backgrounds who have no access to sports facilities and equipment.The initiative will identify talent and nominate players to attend provincial age group trials relevant to ability and potential. It will also encourage aspiring young cricketers to develop their skills and ensure coaching sessions are held within a progressive and fun-filled environment in the spirit of the game. We are confident that in three to five years, cricket will benefit from the immense talent and potential that the initiative will identify from schools. To turn this dream into reality, we will inspire the corporate sector to incorporate sport and education into their corporate social responsibility programmes by adopting an underprivileged school as a way of giving back to communities they do business in, said Rego.Heath Streak International will also inspire and motivate girls to get involved in cricket by engaging in outreach programmes to support young talented girls to train and be coached at the academy, Rego said.The second stage will see the construction of a swimming pool, gymnasium and sports shop.
