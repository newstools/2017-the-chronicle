Footballers unions from five countries, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Democratic Republic of Congo and hosts South Africa, have confirmed participation in the second edition of the regional competition aimed at giving out-of-contract players a platform to market themselves.Desmond Maringwa, the Fuz president, said the competition will be held in Johannesburg.Maringwa said Pasuwa and Ngodzo will identify players for the Fuz team during a training camp that starts next Monday in Harare. Fuz will have a comprehensive training programme to prepare out-of-contract footballers for the regional competition. We ve engaged coaches that are not attached to any club to help us and we re happy that former national team coach Pasuwa and Ngodzo have agreed to be part of the programme. The highly intensive training sessions will be designed to enhance physical abilities, develop and increase tactical as well as technical skills so that the players can perform at the highest level. The main aim of the training camp is to aid players get employment locally and out of the country, Maringwa said.Callisto PasuwaHe said they would also invite local clubs to attend the Fuz training camp as well as the regional competition in South Africa.Maringwa said because of limited funding, they would take a squad of 16 players to the tournament. Fuz approached FIFPro to sponsor the regional players out of contract tournament last year and the competition ran over three days. Last year the tournament was played on a knockout format and we are hoping to have it changed to a group stages format so that more games are played to afford scouts more time to watch the players. Because of limited funding, we ll take a squad of 16 players and two coaches, Maringwa said.After last year s tournament, which had Zimbabwe, DRC, Botswana and South Africa, former Highlanders striker Obert Tafira signed a contract with Pretoria University FC.Besides the regional tournament, Fuz have in the past organised pre-season training camps in Harare and Bulawayo where local clubs could hunt for talent.@ZililoR
