Brian VitoriBULAWAYO Metropolitan Tuskers are on the verge of winning the Pro50 Championship despite their unexpected loss to Midlands Rhinos last Sunday. With 14 points from their four matches, they have a six-point lead over their nearest rivals Manicaland Mountaineers.They need one win from their remaining two matches to clinch the title and can achieve this today against Mountaineers in Mutare.Poor batting contributed to Tuskers defeat last Sunday as the line-up failed to complement Sean Williams 101 and Richmond Mutumbami s 66.In Williams, Mutumbami and Craig Ervine, they have three outstanding batsmen, but the batting is too dependent on the trio.Charles Kunje has made great strides this season, but it is time Brian Chari stood up to be counted.Brian Vitori is Tuskers wild card among their bowlers. His seven wickets devastated Harare Metropolitan Eagles when the teams met in Bulawayo last week, but he was rather ineffective against Rhinos.Chris Mpofu has not often produced his best form with the ball for Tuskers this season and if these two do not fire against Mountaineers then the team may be vulnerable.Mountaineers have the strongest squad of all the four provincial teams, but they have not always done so well in one-day cricket.Consistent performances with both bat and ball earned them victory over Eagles last Sunday, with their top scorer being promising opener Innocent Kaia with 70.Should Tuskers lose, the winner of the match between Rhinos and Eagles in Kwekwe will be in the hunt for the title.Eagles have traditionally been a strong one-day side and have a reputation for rising to the occasion when it really matters.Eagles have Regis Chakabva, Chamu Chibhabha and Sikandar Raza as their leading batsmen, who are complemented by a capable seam-bowling attack.It is also time Elton Chigumbura proved that he is not a spent force and came to the party with the type of devastating innings he can play.Pro50 Championship points tableP W L Tied N/R PtsBulawayo Metro Tuskers 4 3 1 0 0 14Manicaland Mountaineers 4 2 2 0 0 8Midlands Rhinos 4 1 2 0 1 6Harare Metro Eagles 4 1 2 0 1 6Pro50 Championship fixturesToday: Rhinos v Eagles (Kwekwe Sports Club), Mountaineers v Tuskers (Mutare Sports Club)June 6: Eagles v Tuskers (Harare Sports Club), Rhinos v Mountaineers (Kwekwe Sports Club).
