Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya The National Art Gallery in Bulawayo has partnered with the Institute of Creative Arts for Progress in Africa to revive the John Knight Cinema (JKC) which seized operating in 2013 after its patronage dwindled due to piracy and the rise of online movie platforms. The cinema room which was established in honour of architect, John Anthony Knight was popular for screening African films at the art gallery s courtyard.It used to attract a lot of people because of its unique films.Now, to bring back the flair which the cinema used to boast of, the art gallery will once again re-launch the cinema on June 23. People will be expected to pay an annual $20 subscription fee under the JKC Friends of the gallery.JKC films project director, Silenkosi Moyo said that the re-launch would not be open to the public as it will be exclusive to members who would have registered with the gallery. The launch is strictly by invitation. People wishing to see the films will have to become Friends of the Gallery under the JKC category. This way, there ll be guaranteed of a seat in the screenings. They ll also get to view more films throughout the year, said Moyo.Unlike other cinemas in the country which have a bias towards Hollywood blockbuster movies, Moyo said the JKC, would not compete with them, as it will be screening African films with focus on African culture and issues that affect Africans on a daily basis. The main thrust and focus of JKC is to address social issues through cinema. As a result, we ll be showcasing movies which people don t get to see or hear about on a daily basis, said Moyo.
