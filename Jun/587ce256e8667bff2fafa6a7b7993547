Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange A new era on the football landscape in Binga district will be ushered in tomorrow when the Zifa Matabeleland North 2B League kicks off at different venues in the area. The district had been running a 16-team amateur league over the years and Zifa Matabeleland North provincial chairperson Dennis Tshuma said all was now set for the new league. We are all excited over this new Division Binga 2B League which finally kicks off tomorrow after a slight delay due to some logistical issues we wanted to iron out. The league was supposed to kick off at the same time as the 2A League, which is now in Week 5. Ten teams Siansali, Muchesu Bombers, Sowa United, Mangani, Shooting Stars, Kamativi, Lubanda, Lunda, Siawandu and RedSea have confirmed participation, but at the end of the day we are likely to have 12 teams as two more are finalising various processes and will join the following weekend, said Tshuma.He praised the committee that was running the amateur league for its dedication towards the growth of grassroots football. The teams in Binga and other stakeholders in the area who made this dream a reality also deserve special mention, and it clearly demonstrates that it is only through hard work that you can change social leagues into the modern trend of professional leagues, he added.Sports and Recreation Commission provincial coordinator Newman Masuku was elated at the establishment of the new league in Binga. As a ministry, we are elated over this inaugural football platform as it is part of our thrust in conjunction with input of other stakeholders like Zifa to democratise provision of sports in marginalised communities. We hope some young talent from this new league will also form the nucleus of Binga football during the rebranded National Youth Games to be hosted by the province at the end of August 2017. said Masuku.Week 1 fixturesSiansali FC v Muchesu Bombers (Kariyangwe 3pm); Sowa United v Mangani FC(Simatelele 2pm); Shooting Stars v Kamativi(Zvakachila 2pm); Lubanda FC v Lunda FC(Lubanda Pry 3pm); Siawandu FC v RedSea FC( Siawandu 2pm). @tobymandox
