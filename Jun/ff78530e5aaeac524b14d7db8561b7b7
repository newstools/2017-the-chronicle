Norman MapezaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FC Platinum s 13-match unbeaten run in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League might count for nothing in the championship race unless they start turning draws into wins. The platinum miners are seventh on the table with 23 points from 13 outings and they drew their eighth match of the season, a 0-0 stalemate with ZPC Kariba at the weekend.FC Platinum remain the only unbeaten side in the league, but trail log leaders Black Rhinos by four points.Rhinos drew 0-0 against Shabanie Mine, but retained top spot due to a superior goal difference, as they are tied on 27 points with Ngezi Platinum Stars and Chicken Inn.Ngezi blew a perfect opportunity to open a two-point lead at the top of the table after being stunned by the league s whipping boys Bantu Rovers, who forced a share of the points in a 2-2 draw.Rhinos and Ngezi s stuttering allowed Chicken Inn to catch up after registering their fifth consecutive victory by edging relegation bound Tsholotsho FC 1-0.Chicken Inn last lost a league match on May 17 when they fell 0-1 to FC Platinum. They transformed themselves since that loss into serious title contenders.However, their coach Rahman Gumbo refuses to be drawn into the championship talk, saying he is happy with the way they re playing. We have been working hard. We started the season on a rough patch and we found our feet and have been enjoying our game. Hopefully, the players will be able to maintain this fine run and we ll see where it takes us, Gumbo said after their victory over Tsholotsho.Chicken Inn face a stern test in their next match against Ngezi at home.Former champions Dynamos have also been making a steady rise, winning four of their last five outings.Dynamos performance against Chapungu on Sunday cannot go unnoticed even though the match was abandoned in the 58th minute after a goal post fell and couldn t be repaired, with the Harare giants leading 4-0. The outcome will now be decided in the boardroom.Highlanders made several changes to their regular starting line-up and threw in youngsters in their game against Hwange.Rodreck Mutuma, Tendai Ngulube, Allen Gahadzikwa, Simon Munawa and Benson Dube were all left out as Bosso dispatched Hwange 3-0.Highlanders coach Erol Akbay said: Every time we play a team that is at the bottom of the log, we always experience problems and that s why I changed the team. Brian Banda, King Nadolo and Prince Dube were on target for Bosso.Bulawayo City eased pressure on themselves by piling more misery on Yadah FC with a 2-1 victory, while Harare City dismissed Triangle 2-0 to move out of the relegation zone.Results Saturday: ZPC Kariba 0-0 FC Platinum, Tsholotsho FC 0-1 Chicken Inn Sunday: Highlanders 3-0 Hwange, Bulawayo City 2-1 Yadah FC, Harare City 2-0 Triangle United, Shabanie Mine 0-0 Black Rhinos, Ngezi Platinum 2-2 Bantu Rovers, Chapungu 0-4 Dynamos (match abandoned after 56 minutes)TableP W D L F A GD Pts Black Rhinos 13 8 3 2 16 4 12 27 Ngezi Platinum Stars 14 8 3 3 23 13 10 27 Chicken Inn 13 9 0 4 15 5 10 27 Highlanders 14 7 3 4 16 13 3 24 How Mine 13 7 3 3 11 9 2 24 *Dynamos 12 7 2 3 16 9 7 23 FC Platinum 13 5 8 0 11 5 6 23 ZPC Kariba 14 7 2 5 17 14 3 23 Bulawayo City 14 5 2 7 13 16 -3 17 Shabanie Mine 14 3 6 5 10 12 -2 15 *Chapungu 13 3 6 4 7 10 -3 15 Triangle United 14 3 6 5 11 15 -4 15 Harare City 14 3 5 6 6 7 -1 14 Caps United 8 3 4 1 14 7 7 13 Yadah FC 14 3 4 7 12 19 -7 13 Hwange 13 2 4 7 7 18 -11 10 Bantu Rovers 14 2 2 10 18 34 -16 8 Tsholotsho FC 14 0 5 9 6 19 -13 5 *match abandoned@ZililoR
