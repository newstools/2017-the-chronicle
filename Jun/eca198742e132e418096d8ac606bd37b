The scotch cart was flattened and Ngwenya died on the spot together with his donkeys. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Siphiwe Makonese confirmed the incident.She urged motorists and road users to observe road rules and regulations to avoid unnecessary loss of lives as a result of accidents. Police are urging motorists to be observant, cautious and ensure they do not speed, overtake in dangerous situations and above all safeguard lives on the road. Let us all drive to arrive alive and contribute towards safety on the roads. Drivers should not be reckless and where possible avoid travelling at night, said Insp Makonese. Members of the public should desist from using scotch carts on highways, especially at night when visibility is poor. Scotch carts should have reflectors to avoid accidents .Last month, seven people died in an accident involving a DAF CF lorry, a Nissan Caravan and an ox-drawn scotch cart along Kwekwe-Gokwe Road near Summerview Mine.@winnie_masara
