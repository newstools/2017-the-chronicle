Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO S Sir Humphrey Gibbs Training Centre was yesterday crowned champions of the 2017 edition of the Zimcare Trust National Games held at White City Stadium. The centre scooped four gold, three silver and three bronze medals. Manicaland s Chengetai School for the Intellectually Challenged came second with three gold, one silver and three bronze, while Homefield Centre (Mashonaland West) came third with two gold, six silver and three bronze.The two-day event saw athletes from Zimcare Trust Centres dotted across the country competing in athletics, volleyball, sitting volleyball, netball, five-a-side soccer and tag rugby.In a speech read on his behalf by Southern Region Sports director Isaiah Mpofu, Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane said they appreciate efforts being made by voluntary organisations like Zimcare Trust which promote sport, especially for people living with disabilities. In this very harsh economic climate, it would be easy to forget our less privileged brothers and sisters and direct our efforts to those we deem able. This initiative is in line with my ministry s mandate to promote and develop sports for all, where people, especially those living with disabilities, can actually earn a living out of their God given talents in sports, said Hlongwane.He challenged Zimcare Trust to also partake in the Zimbabwe Paralympic Games where athletes can be identified and selected for further training and be able to develop their talents further.Zimcare Trust national director Nicholas Aribino said they are hoping to expand the annual competition by including other institutions of people living with disabilities. @khumzallen
