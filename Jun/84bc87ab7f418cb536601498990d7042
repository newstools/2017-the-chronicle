Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter SAINTS Academy will be hoping to register their second win of the season when they play host to Mpopoma Pirates at Sotshangane ground in a Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Two Soccer League match today. Having played six matches, Saints Academy only managed to collect their first set of points in the league after beating How Mine 1-0 last week.They are 12th on the league table with five points from one win and two draws.Their coach Stokefield Mlambo believes the win was a big boost to his charges ahead of today s clash. I have to give credit to the boys for the way they played against an experienced side like How Mine who are seasoned contenders, so a win against them was a good thing. This is a big boost for us as we have been struggling to win since joining the league. Confidence is high in camp and we are looking forward to doing our best in the coming games, said Mlambo.He, however, said they are not reading much into the win as he feels they still have a long way to go. We are not letting this win get the better of us because we still have other games to play and tougher teams to face. I know after such wins players tend to lose focus and take other games lightly. We are taking each game as it comes and hopefully we will maintain the standard, he said.In other matches, table toppers Toronto FC will be hoping to continue with their fine form in the league when they visit Arenel Movers at Nduba.Toronto and CIWU are jointly leading the table with 14 from four wins and two draws.Today s fixturesToday: Arenel Movers v Toronto (Nduba), Chicken Inn v White Birds (Njube Desert), LSU Utd v Lobengula Stars (Raylton), Saints Academy v Mpopoma Pirates (Sotshangene), CIWU v How Mine (Eveline High School), Ajax Hotspurs v Sabona Mzilikazi (Bango), Zenzele Tigers v Main Line Academy (Barbourfields outside grounds).Tomorrow:White Birds v CS Distributors (Marisha)Table:TEAM P W D L F A PTSToronto 6 4 2 0 15 5 14CIWU 6 4 2 0 13 5 14Mpopoma Pirates 6 4 1 1 13 7 13Ajax Hotspurs 6 4 1 1 10 5 13Arenel Movers 6 3 2 1 10 6 11How Mine 6 3 1 2 10 6 10Mainline Academy 6 2 3 1 9 6 9Chicken Inn 6 2 3 1 7 5 9Sabona Mzilikazi 6 2 2 2 10 7 8Zenzele Tigers 5 2 1 2 5 5 7Lobengula Stars 6 2 0 4 8 11 6Saints Academy 6 1 2 3 6 11 5White Birds 5 1 1 3 6 10 4Khami United 6 1 0 5 8 15 3LSU Utd 5 0 1 4 2 17 1CS Distributors 5 0 0 5 2 13 0 @khumzallen&nbsp;
