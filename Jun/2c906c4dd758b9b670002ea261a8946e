Tsholotsho District Administrator Mrs Gladys Zizhou yesterday confirmed that more than 300 families that were affected by floods in Tsholotsho district had been relocated from the transit camp.She said the families had been moved to their stands so that they could assist in the construction of their homes. We started relocating the flood victims last week and I m glad that more than 800 flood victims have been moved to their new homes. Instead of them continuing to be congested at the transit camp, we decided to move them to their new stands so that they can assist in the building of their new homes. The families moved with their tents which they will continue to use until the completion of their houses, said Mrs Zizhou.She, however, said some school children remained at the camp due to logistical challenges, adding that they will soon be relocated.Mrs Zizhou said 300 toilets were constructed and the District Development Fund (DDF) has also started drilling boreholes at the new sites. We ve completed the construction of 164 toilets at Tshino and 136 at Sawudweni. The families were excited to move to the new areas to build permanent homes. It was not easy for them to live normal lives at the transit camp, said Mrs Zizhou.She appealed to well-wishers to assist with building materials to enable families to build houses as well as stationery for pupils.Government pledged to build a three-roomed house, a separate kitchen hut and a toilet for each of the affected families.A secondary school, clinic and a police base are also expected to be constructed to service the relocated villagers.Tsholotsho District was one of the hardest hit by Cyclone Dineo induced floods last February and some of the marooned families had to be airlifted to Sipepa Hospital where Government had established a transit camp.Affected villages included Mahlosi, Mahlaba, Thamuhla, Mbamba, Mele, Lutshome, Maphili and Mbanyana.More than 300 stands have been pegged at Tshino and Sawudweni villages in Ward Six of Tsholotsho North. @pamelashumba1
