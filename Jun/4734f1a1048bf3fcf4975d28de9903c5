The former champions kept their title hopes on track courtesy of goals by captain Kundishora Chakanyuka and defensive midfielder Takunda Muzuva. The win took their points tally to 25 points in nine outings.Chiefs are nine points above second-placed ZRP Bulawayo, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Talen Vision.Chiefs coach Thulani Sibanda said they were within their target of going unbeaten for the first 10 matches.Despite emerging victorious on Sunday, Sibanda was still not pleased with his team s finishing. As a coach you can t be satisfied and have to keep on working hard and that is why I m saying we have to bury the chances that we create. We play well, create chances, but fluff those opportunities. I will be happier if we learn to convert the chances we create. I think we ve shown that we are real championship contenders and we are on course to achieve our 10-match unbeaten run. However, despite the fact that we are playing well and collecting points, we should guard against complacency because the race is still open, said Sibanda.Chiefs next opponents are fourth-placed Talen Vision, who trail the leaders by 11 points.Last season, Chiefs beat Talen Vision 2-0 in the first leg and went on to lose the reverse fixture 1-2.ZPC Hwange moved a place up the ladder into fifth courtesy of a 3-0 home win over Amagagasi to take their points tally to 13 points from six games.Ex-Chiefs attacking midfielder Desire Shumbanhete, Mlungisi Ndlovu and Kudakwashe Sithole were on target for ZPC Hwange.Amagagasi, who put in a strong title challenge last season, seem to be struggling to replicate last year s form, which had earned them a 2017 pre-season championship favourites tag.Amos Ndlovu and Tawanda Mushongwe s goals powered Makomo to a 2-1 away win over Indlovu Iyanyathela at HQ One Brigade, with the army side scoring their consolation through Collins Tshuma.Highlanders developmental side Bosso 90 registered their second victory of the season at the weekend when they beat Chiwororo 1-0 at Luveve Stadium.Police side Black Boots moved from the bottom of the table for the first time after beating Victoria Falls Tigers 1-0 in the resort town through a Tendai Zaza goal.Black Boots jumped three places up to 11th, with six points from seven games.ResultsSaturday: Victoria Falls Tigers 0-1 Black Boots, Indlovu Iyanyathela 1-2 Makomo, Bosso 90 1-0 Chiwororo, ZPC Hwange 3-0 Amagagasi, ZRP Bulawayo Province 0-0 Talen VisionSunday: Bulawayo Chiefs 2-0 Mosi RoversTableP W D L F A GD Pts Bulawayo Chiefs 9 8 1 0 19 2 17 25 ZRP Bulawayo 8 4 4 0 12 3 9 16 Casmyn 8 4 2 2 12 5 7 14 Talen Vision 9 3 5 1 8 4 4 14 ZPC Hwange 6 4 1 1 8 1 7 13 Indlovu Iyanyathela 7 3 1 3 11 8 3 10 Bosso 90 7 2 4 1 7 7 0 10 Makomo 7 2 2 3 5 10 -5 8 Mosi Rovers 9 2 2 5 8 18 -10 8 Zim Leopards 8 1 4 3 15 15 0 7 Black Boots 7 1 3 3 6 17 -11 6 Chiwororo 6 1 1 4 9 13 -4 4 Amagagasi 7 1 1 5 4 11 -7 4 Victoria Falls Tigers 7 0 3 4 3 12 -9 3@ZililoR
