Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter SIX teams are set to battle it out in the Insiza District Women s Soccer League that was launched in March this year at Nkankezi Secondary School as a way of spreading the game across the country. The league, which is expected to kick-off this month, will see Nkankezi Secondary, Sebatha Secondary, JZ Moyo High, Filabusi Secondary, Mthwakazi Secondary and Sidzibe Secondary fighting for honours.ZWSL vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane said she is happy to see rural teams embracing the association s initiative of spreading the women s game to the grassroots level. It s a really good thing to see that rural teams have welcomed our move to spread women s soccer across the country. There is so much talent that needs nurturing in rural areas so having teams committing to the league will surely go a long way in achieving that. It s a really good development and we are slowly getting there. Good times are rolling out for women s soccer as rural girls are getting equal opportunities, Silengane said.She invited other schools to join the league to strengthen competition. To start the league with six teams is actually a good thing and I believe some teams will join once everything is running. I just want to encourage those that have not joined the league to do so.The association is working tirelessly to ensure that women s football is spread to all parts of the country and with time we hope to see vibrant rural leagues, she said.@khumzallen
