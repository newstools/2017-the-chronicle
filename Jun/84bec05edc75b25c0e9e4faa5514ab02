Youth League provincial secretary for information and publicity (Mat North) Elias SibandaLeonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Zanu-PF Matabeleland North Youth League is calling on artistes from the province to register to perform at next month s Presidential interface rally. The revolutionary party s Matabeleland North youth leadership set July 14 as the date for the Presidential Youth Interface rally to be held at Somhlolo Stadium in Lupane.Elias Sibanda, who is Youth League provincial secretary for information and publicity in the province, said they want local artistes from the province to provide entertainment to about 70 000 people expected to attend the event. Entertainment groups from the province should get in touch with us so we start planning for the day in terms of entertainment, said Sibanda.He said this will be an opportunity for up-and-coming musicians and dance groups from the province to market themselves. While our main aim is to entertain people, the artistes will have an opportunity to market themselves in front of the whole province and nation at large.It s our wish that local groups come and shine because we don t want to import musicians from elsewhere when we can promote locals, said Sibanda.Zanu-PF has taken it upon itself to uplift budding artistes in the province, with a number of unheralded musicians being given an opportunity to perform at the recent Independence Day celebrations held at the provincial capital in April.President Mugabe is moving around the country meeting youths. He has held similar rallies in Mashonaland East and Manicaland provinces while today he will be in Masvingo before he heads to Matabeleland North. @ncubeleon.
