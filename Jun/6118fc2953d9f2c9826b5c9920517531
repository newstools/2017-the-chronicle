Thabani KamusokoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NATIONAL team returnee Thabani Kamusoko believes the Warriors 3-0 victory against Liberia in the 2019 Afcon qualifier opener gave Zimbabwe a perfect platform to launch a strong bid for the continental finals set for Cameroon. Kamusoko (29) last played for the Warriors in 2009 and put on a spirited show alongside goalkeeper George Chigova, defenders Erick Chipeta and Patson Jaure, who were all recalled into the national team set-up.The dreadlocked midfielder alongside Chipeta, Chigova and Jaure repaid Warriors interim coach Norman Mapeza s faith in them with good performances.The inclusion of Kamusoko in the starting line-up after a long spell away from the Warriors had drawn criticism from some sectors, but the Young Africans midfielder played the game of his life.Coming from a successful season in Tanzania where he helped Young Africans win a second title in a row, Kamusoko won many hearts at the National Sports Stadium by combining well with Danny Phiri and Marvelous Nakamba to control the midfield.Kamusoko s free-kick from outside the box which rattled the upright four minutes before halftime could have sealed a good day in the office for him. I m happy to have performed well on my return to the national team. Even though it s over five years since I last played for the Warriors, I never lost hope and I guess the hard work at my club has paid off. I m grateful to the coach, who showed faith in me, and my teammates for the way we complemented each other, said Kamusoko.The former FC Platinum, Dynamos and Njube Sundowns midfielder said victory over Liberia was a good start for the Warriors campaign. Some people may say Liberia are a weak side because they have lost a number of games, but to us what was key is a good start. A convincing victory to lift the players confidence is all that mattered. God willing, I ll still be part of the Warriors when the qualifiers resume next season and I ll keep working hard, Kamusoko said.Warriors captain Knowledge Musona scored all three goals for Zimbabwe against Liberia to join the exclusive clique of Zimbabweans that have scored hat-tricks for the national team, who include Peter Ndlovu and Vitalis Takawira.The Warriors compact midfield that had Kamusoko, Nakamba, Phiri and winger Mahachi made it virtually impossible for Liberia to play the ball, let alone run at the defenders.Because of the Warriors dominance, defenders ended up joining the attack, with Jaure providing Musona s assist for the third goal.Phiri provided the assist for Musona s first goal, with Mahachi coming in with the assist for the Warriors skipper s second.With a bit of precision in front of goal, the Warriors could have won by a huge margin.They should, however, be commended for their ability to use the whole pitch, as they attacked through the centre and the wings effortlessly.Mapeza aptly summed up his team s performance. It was a good game of football. I think we just won it in all departments. We defended well, we were compact in midfield and upfront we were just clinical. I say congratulations to the boys, they worked so hard, said Mapeza.He believes he has laid a strong foundation for the team s campaign.Mapeza and his assistants Mandla Mpofu and Tonderai Ndiraya made a number of changes to the squad, with seven survivors from the Warriors disastrous Gabon 2017 Afcon finals campaign.The Afcon finals survivors are Musona, defenders Onismor Bhasera and Teenage Hadebe, the midfield trio of Kuda Mahachi, MarvelousNakamba and Danny Phiri and strikers Tendai Ndoro and Evans Rusike.The Warriors next Afcon qualifier is set for March 2018 in Congo Brazzaville.Group G resultsSaturday: DRC 3-1 Congo Brazzaville Sunday: Zimbabwe 3-0 LiberiaFixturesMarch 23, 2018: Congo v Zimbabwe, Liberia v DRC September 5, 2018: DRC v Zimbabwe, Congo v Liberia September 9, 2018: Zimbabwe v DRC, Liberia v Congo October 12, 2018: Congo v DRC, Liberia v Zimbabwe November 9, 2018: Zimbabwe v Congo, DRC v LiberiaGroup G TableP W D L F A GD Pts Zimbabwe 1 1 0 0 3 0 3 3 DRC 1 1 0 0 3 1 2 3 Congo 1 0 0 1 1 3 -2 0 Liberia 1 0 0 1 0 3 -3 0@ZililoR
