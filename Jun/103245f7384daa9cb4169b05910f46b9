WEERAMS are confident of causing a major upset when they play host to visiting Highlanders Royals in a Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League tie at Glen View 4 Primary School in Harare tomorrow. We have full respect for Highlanders Royals, but the truth is we want maximum points. We started with a draw and if we get a win, it will boost morale in my camp, said Charles Bepete, the Weerams coach.Weerams will be looking up to star player, Samantha Peter, who was plucked from Guruve to lead them in the game against Highlanders.They also have Loice Shereni, Ashley Million and Melania Magore in defence to thwart any attack.Striker Nomsa Bizeki and her striker partner, Elizabeth Bvunzawabaya, are expected to lead the home team s frontline.Elsewhere, Mwenezana Queens will be fighting for bragging rights in the Masvingo derby against Masvingo Queens.Mwenezana are favourites on paper as Masvingo are struggling and presently sit second from bottom on the league table. Zvishavane Pirates will make the trip to Bulawayo to face Inline Academy.Pirates are yet to register a win and the best they have done was a goalless draw against Chipembere.Samkeliso Silengane, the Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League vice-chairperson, yesterday said her board had shifted all league matches from Sunday to tomorrow. Our national team is playing on Sunday and we want to give everyone the chance to go and rally behind our boys, so there will be no league games on Sunday. We have to respect our boys and we are going to play our games on Saturday. As the Women s Soccer League executive, we wish our Warriors all the best, said Silengane.Black Rhinos, Auckland, MSU, Weerams, Highlanders Royals, Herentals, ZRP Morris Depot and ZRP Mbare, who were playing in a breakaway league not recognised by Zifa, were welcomed back to the elite league last week. We just wanted a united league and by them not playing in our league, they were not going to be considered for the national team. There is Zifa licensing and their players were also not going to be considered for national selection. We are now happy that all the talent has come on board and we hope to build a strong Mighty Warriors team, she said.FixturesTomorrow: Mufakose Queens v Cyclone Stars (Mufakose High 1PM); Mwenezana Queens v Masvingo Queens (Mwenezana Stadium 1PM); Blue Swallows v Hearts Of Oak (Manyame Airbase 3PM); Correctional Queens v Street Set (Chikurubi Training Base 3PM); Inline Academy v Zvishavane Pirates (Barbourfields B Arena 1PM); New Orleans v Faith Drive (Luveve 12PM); ZRP Queens v Conduit Soccer Academy (Morris Depot 1PM); Chipembere Queens v Barrow Street Jets (Mkoba Stadium 2PM); MSU v ZRP Morris (MSU 11AM); Weerams v Highlanders Royals (Glen View 4 2PM); Auckland v Herentals (Bindura Stadium 1PM); ZRP Harare v Black Rhinos (Morgan High School 2PM)
