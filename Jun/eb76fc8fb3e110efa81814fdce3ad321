Denford MutamangiraAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE senior rugby team captain Denford Mutamangira has promised the nation the best performance when they face Senegal in a crucial Rugby Africa Gold Cup opening match in Dakar on Saturday. The 32-year-old prop was retained as the Sables captain for the third successive season since taking over in 2015 from Harare Sports Club and Cheetahs coach Daniel Hondo, who retired from international rugby at the end of the failed Sables World Cup qualifier in 2014.Mutamangira will be deputised by Old Hararians flyhalf Tichafara Makwanya.Mutamangira said the country needs to change its approach to major competitions if they are to reach greater heights. Preparation is key and unfortunately it s something that we have not managed to do as Zimbabwe and I don t know why. It s something that we have been talking about for years now, but nobody seems to be taking it really seriously. People think a game is won within the 80 minutes of play, but preparation is key to everything, said Mutamangira.After the Senegal trip, Zimbabwe will head to Windhoek for a clash with Namibia on July 15 before hosting Kenya on July 22.A week later, the Sables will play Tunisia in Harare before completing their campaign with a tie against Uganda on August 5.The tournament presents the Sables with a great opportunity to qualify for the 2019 World Cup in Japan after Rugby Africa further altered the qualifying process. Zimbabwe were relegated from Group 1A last year after a disappointing campaign, but were given a reprieve and remain in the top tier.Sables squad Forwards: Denford Mutamangira, Lawrence Cleminson, Irvine Nduwa, Brian Makamure, Tolerance Zishe, Graham Cochrane, Takudzwa Bvunzawabaya, Brian Nyaude, Witness Mandizha, Fortune Chipendu, Takudzwa Mandiwanza, Connor Pritchard, Biselele Tshamala, Lucky Sithole and Osborne MuhambiBacks: Hilton Mudariki, Scott Jones, Joshua Gando, Tichafara Makwanya, Lenience Tambwera, Gideon Muyambo, Tarisai Mugariri, Daniel Capsopoulos, Boyd Rouse, Ngoni Chibuwe, Stephan Hunduza, Takudzwa Kumadiro, Tadius Hwata and Tinashe Gwisai.@khumzallen
