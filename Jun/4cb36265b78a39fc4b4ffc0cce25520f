Your Worship my wife left for South Africa in 2015. I m the one who was looking after the children since then. I saw no point in paying the maintenance money since I was living with the children. I was doing everything for them from school fees, food and clothes. She only took them back on May 10 this year, said Bhebhe.Prosecuting, Ms Magret Takawira said Bhebhe was ordered to pay $150 in October 2014.
