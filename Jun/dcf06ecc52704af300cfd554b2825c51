Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Bulawayo Metropolitan Province has given its nod for Wushu to be introduced in schools in a bid to attract more students to the traditional Chinese martial arts. Wushu is similar to kung fu and is an exhibition and full contact combat sport that allows the use of protective gear like headgear, gloves and leather armour. It is of Chinese origin and Wu means military, while Shu is art in Chinese, hence the art has military inclinations.According to a letter from the ministry, the Bulawayo Wushu Association (BWA) will work with already qualified Wushu trainers from various schools. I m pleased to inform you that the Provincial Education Director has granted you permission to continue working with schools you were working with the previous year (2016) until the fruits of your programme are realised. You are therefore advised to work with our Wushu trained teachers at the following schools; Hamilton, Nketa, Nkulumane, Inyanda and Cowdray Park secondary schools, reads a letter from the ministry.BWA chairperson Giyani Moyo said the move is in line with the Ministry of Sport and Recreation s initiative of promoting minor sporting disciplines across the country. Wushu kung-fu is already embraced by some schools. The awareness must cut across so that it can be a household sport at grassroots level, said Moyo.@khumzallen
