Minister Lindiwe ZuluPamela Shumba, Senior Reporter South Africa s Minister of Small Business Development, Lindiwe Zulu, has said some middlemen are making mega profits out of the sweat of African handicraft producers, taking advantage of their failure to directly access lucrative markets. She called on governments to assist small to medium enterprises to grow their business and tap into regional markets so as to increase their earnings and contribute to the improvement of their countries economies.Minister Zulu, who was in Bulawayo for the Coordination Committee for Development and Promotion of African Handicrafts (CODEPA) conference that ended Friday, commended the handicrafts being exhibited at the conference saying it was important for governments to work together in promoting the small to medium enterprises sector. I m impressed by the handicrafts I m seeing here but I believe we can do more. As governments we should come together and make sure that what is being produced in the continent is of high quality and standards so that it can compete in the global market, said Minister Zulu. It s unfortunate that there are some people who are making money through our crafters. They pay very little for their products and sell them for higher prices. We, therefore, need to create global markets that will see crafters making more through their products and at the same time contributing to the growth of their economies. Minister Zulu said in South Africa her ministry has a department of small business development that offers financial support, incentives as well as training in entrepreneurship To address the financial challenges that our SMEs are facing, we are giving them the support they need. The trainings have helped our SMEs to understand the markets and know what exactly people want.They have also helped them produce good quality products that are of international standards, said Minister Zulu.The handicrafts sector, one of the biggest employers especially of women and youths is crucial for the African economy with a significant contribution of between five and 30 percent of GDP in member countries.The objective of the conference was to create a platform for member states to promote ways of circulating information on the art and craft sector in African countries and develop integrated craft hubs that create an effective enabling environment to ensure products reach markets.The conference was also expected to develop research and development capabilities for the arts and handicrafts sector and ensure the free flow of information.@pamelashumba1
