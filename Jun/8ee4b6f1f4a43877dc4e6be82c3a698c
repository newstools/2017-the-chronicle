Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter THE younger brother to the late notorious robber and murderer Edmond Edgar Masendeke, Andrew, who was facing armed robbery, unlawful entry, carjacking and kidnapping charges was yesterday sentenced to 26 years in prison. Masendeke (21) of Mukarati Village under Chief Mukaro in Gutu had pleaded guilty before Gweru Regional Magistrate Mr Morgan Nemadire. Seven years were suspended on condition that he restitutes some of his robbery victims $4 067.The other seven years were suspended on condition of good behaviour leaving him with 12 effective years in prison.Mr Nemadire said he had considered that Masendeke is a young first offender. I considered that you have no savings in your name, you survive on gold panning, you committed the crime under the influence of your accomplices some of whom are still at large and you are willing to restitute the victims. What is aggravating is that you benefited from the property you stole. Because you are a first offender you will receive what we term a discount on your sentence but your offences deserve the most severe punishment that will discourage and serve as a lesson to you that you do not commit similar crimes, he said.The younger Masendeke and his three accomplices Tapiwa Chimuti (29), Anyway Madala (27) and Simbarashe Machiritsa (40) who are all from Ascot Infill high-density suburb in Gweru targeted a cop, miners and businesspeople in the Midlands province and Bulawayo getting away with more than $25 000, a vehicle and six rifles. Two other suspects Matrimony Nyathi and Sydney Mangisi are still on the run.Chimuti, Madala and Machiritsa were previously sentenced to a collective 188 years after being linked to a spate of armed robberies committed in Bulawayo, Zvishavane, Gweru, Shurugwi, Kwekwe and Kadoma. Chimuti was sentenced to 91 years, Madala 76 and Machiritsa 21.The State led by Mr Ernest Mzembi said between February and June this year, Masendeke and his accomplices committed a series of robberies in the Midlands and Bulawayo and kidnapped a police officer.Police recovered the vehicle and guns which were used during the robberies and the property has since been forfeited to the State.The gang also robbed mines and business people of money, vehicles and rifles &#8211; @amanda49
