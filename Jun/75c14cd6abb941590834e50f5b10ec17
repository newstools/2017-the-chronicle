Office staff proudly display the awardEngineer Newton Mlotshwa Nemaks Construction and Engineering Services was founded in 1993. Unlike the construction businesses that existed at the time, which were by and large family businesses or businesses inherited from previous generations, Nemaks was starting from scratch with the vision to create a sustainable business that would not only benefit the existing stakeholders but leave a lasting legacy for future generations. As such, while, like any other business, the overall objective is to make profit, it was clear that creating a reputation for quality work and service requiring a hands-on approach would have to be one of the primary objectives. In the absence of a strict regulatory environment, it is incumbent upon the company itself to set high goals of quality and performance standards.Nemaks has thus always maintained professionalism, integrity, reliability and high quality standards as the core values of the business. Despite the fact that the company has carried out many housing, building and engineering projects over the years, survival and growth can be attributed to the niche market segment that it serves. The company has made deliberate efforts to serve the upmarket, professional and institutional clients who believe in value for money and are happy to pay for quality.Mrs Josephine Mhlanga hands over the ZNCC Constructor of the Year 2016 award to the Nemaks Construction and Engineering Services Managing Director, Engineer Newton MlotshwaThis has allowed the company to focus on its core competence in reinforced concrete works and other civil engineering structures. The company prides itself in the construction of foundations for more than 50 telecoms base stations countrywide including some of the most remote and difficult mountain sites in the country such as Mount Tundazi in the middle of Chizarira Game Park in Binga in the last few years.Similarly, the kibble winder bases for Blanket Mine involving no less than 40 tonnes of reinforcement steel and 500 cubic metres concrete for each of the two bases is a source of pride.While the company would like to remain focused on its key competences, diversification is an imperative in the current economic environment and as such, plans to go into property development are at an advanced stage.-Engineer Newton Mlotshwa is the managing director of Nemaks Construction and Engineering Services.
