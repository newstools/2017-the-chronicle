Erol AkbayRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS coach Erol Akbay has accepted losing three points to Dynamos via the boardroom and wants to win the away match against Black Rhinos at Morris Depot tomorrow. Bosso were last week slapped with a $4 000 fine by the PSL disciplinary committee after being found guilty of causing the abandonment of a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against archrivals Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium on May 14.The PSL disciplinary tribunal also awarded Dynamos the match on a 3-0 score line and ordered Bosso to pay the $4 000 as well as costs of the hearing by July 31, 2017.Although Akbay feels the decision to award Dynamos three points was harsh, he wants his charges to bring maximum points from their Harare trip.Bosso have won only once on the road this season, 2-1 against Tsholotsho FC in Beitbridge.On the road, they drew 0-0 against Chapungu and Harare City, and their match against FC Platinum was abandoned in injury time with the two teams tied 1-1 at Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane.That 1-1 against FC Platinum has since been ratified by the PSL. We have no choice in the Rhinos game, but to win. Remember we lost points to Dynamos in a way that I don t understand. We have to win against Rhinos so that we stay with the top teams, said Akbay.The Dutchman knows that playing Rhinos, who are second on the league table with 23 points and just three behind log leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars, will not be easy. Rhinos are a difficult team and they have a good defence, which has only conceded four goals in 11 games. We need to be focused at the back because they also score goals and our strikers need to be sharp for this game, said Akbay.Bosso are eighth on the table with 21 points and gave their players a break last week.This means the Bulawayo giants, who leave for Harare this morning, will face Rhinos having only trained twice, on Sunday and yesterday.Rhinos have a strong squad that includes right-back Jameson Mukombwe, who was on the bench when the Warriors beat Liberia 3-0 at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday, central defender Sydney Linyama, left-winger Milton Kureva, strikers Lot Chiwunga and Benjamin Marere. They have a good home record and have only dropped points once in five home games in the 0-0 draw with FC Platinum on May 2.Teams that have lost to Rhinos at home include Chapungu, Bantu Rovers, Hwange and Yadah Stars FC.FixturesToday: Caps United v Bantu Rovers (National Sports Stadium, 6PM) Tomorrow: Chapungu v Bulawayo City (Ascot), Chicken Inn v ZPC Kariba (Luveve), FC Platinum v Harare City (Mandava), Black Rhinos v Highlanders (Morris Depot), Triangle United v Shabanie Mine (Gibbo) Thursday: Bantu Rovers v Tsholotsho FC (Luveve), How Mine v Yadah FC (Luveve), Dynamos v Ngezi Platinum (National Sports Stadium, 7PM), Hwange v Caps United (Postponed)Updated Table P W D L F A GD Pts Ngezi Platinum Stars 12 8 2 2 19 8 11 26 Black Rhinos 11 7 2 2 13 4 9 23 ZPC Kariba 12 7 1 4 17 12 5 22 Chicken Inn 11 7 0 4 12 5 7 21 FC Platinum 11 5 6 0 11 5 6 21 Highlanders 12 6 3 3 13 10 3 21 How Mine 12 6 3 3 9 8 1 21 Dynamos 11 6 2 3 13 7 6 20 Shabanie Mine 12 3 5 4 9 9 0 14 Bulawayo City 12 4 2 6 11 14 -3 14 Yadah FC 12 3 4 5 10 15 -5 13 Triangle United 12 2 6 4 8 12 -4 12 Chapungu 2 2 6 4 6 10 -4 12 Caps United 7 2 4 1 11 7 4 10 Harare City 12 2 4 6 4 7 -3 10 Hwange 12 2 4 6 7 15 -8 10 Bantu Rovers 11 2 0 9 15 28 -13 6 Tsholotsho FC 12 0 4 8 5 17 -12 4@ZililoR
