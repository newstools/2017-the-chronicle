Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls REFURBISHMENT of Victoria Falls dysfunctional public swimming pool is almost complete with contractors saying it should be ready for use before the 15th edition of the rebranded Zimbabwe National Youth Games in August. The Youth Games will run from August 17-27, with Hwange and Victoria Falls being the nerve centres of the event.Matabeleland North province hosts this year s edition and Victoria Falls and Hwange are set to provide facilities for most of the 22 disciplines.There was concern that the swimming pool, part of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation General Assembly legacy funded project, would not materialise because of delays in the release of $60 000 allocated for it.The money was set aside three years ago after the country successfully co-hosted the historic UNWTO General Assembly, and the Victoria Falls business community had suggested that the money be used to construct a swimming pool with a multi-purpose facility to attract world competitions to further boost tourism.Tourism and Hospitality Minister Walter Mzembi toured the facility with the steering committee yesterday and reiterated that commissioning would be done in mid-July. I came here to assess progress because UNWTO want to come and commission the facility in July. We chose to develop the disused pool as a way to thank the people of Victoria Falls by giving them a facility for their children, said Mzembi. From what we see and what we have been told, it will be ready for the coming youth games, he said.Chairperson of the steering committee Olga Mutamba said they were now putting final touches on the facility. We are hoping that all things being equal we will be done next month, as we are left with a few finishing touches and reducing the depth of the pool so that it also accommodates minors. We will reduce depth a bit, but keep it at near-Olympic standard, Mutamba said.The re-branded games will have 22 sporting disciplines involve members of the uniformed forces as well as tertiary institutions who will compete in the Under-23 category for the first time.The new sport codes are rowing, swimming, rugby, hockey, rowing cricket, pool, chess, darts, gymnastics, weightlifting, martial arts, cycling, table tennis, traditional games, in addition to the generic football, basketball, handball, tennis, volleyball, boxing, athletics and netball. &#8211; @ncubeleon
