Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter GOVERNMENT mining inspectors are not visible on the ground resulting in a number of workers getting exposed to hazardous working conditions due to relaxed safety procedures, an official has said. Speaking during the 45th anniversary commemorations of the Kamandama Mine disaster in Hwange on Tuesday, the Associated Mine Workers Union of Zimbabwe (AMWUZ) president Mr Edmund Ruzive said: We are saying to Government, your inspectorate department is not visible in the mine industry, workers are exposed to serious dangers of mercury, falls of ground in underground, bad hangings due to lack of support of rocks in tunnels and gassing. There are also cases of poor ventilation and workers being killed in accidents underground due to relaxed safety procedures. Mr Ruzive said Statutory Instrument 152 of 1990 clearly stipulates that the employer should provide two sets of protective clothing per annum made up of overalls, goggles, helmets, gumboots respirators and earplugs but some employers were not providing these essentials.He said for growth and development of the mining sector, there was a need for safety and health to be prioritised. Zimbabwe is endowed with a number of mineral resources which are dotted all over the country which if the mineral value is unlocked, can lead to massive job creation and an improved quality of life, said Mr Ruzive.Mr Ruzive said the union was appealing to the Government to ensure the granting of mineral rights is tied to specific social and labour deliverables.@skhumoyo2000
