Disbursements of $142 million were made towards capital and other development projects, said Treasury.The breakdown includes among others: $15 million for projects in the transport sector, $16.9 million for water and sanitation projects, $2.3 million for e-governance flagship projects and national data centre equipment installation, $2.3 million institutional housing projects, health and education projects as well as agriculture, Government vehicles, strategic grain reserves, shareholding in international organisations, to mention a few, which chewed more than $100 million.During the period, employment costs constituted 67 percent of the $1.1 billion total expenditure, while interest obligations amounting to $41 million were paid in the first three months. The country s exports grew by 16 percent to reach $723.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $625.2 million realised in the corresponding period in 2016. Major exports included tobacco at $203 million, gold ($182) million, ferro-chrome ($84 million) and nickel ($85 million). South Africa remained the biggest trading partner, with exports worth $561 million being recorded while Mozambique was the second at $87 million worth of exports.Imports stood at $1.34 billion compared to $1.30 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2016, representing a three percent increase.

Maize imports amounted to $119 million, whilst crude soya oil was $24 million.The trade deficit for the first quarter narrowed to $614 million in 2017 compared to $675 million during the same period.

On the financial services sector, Treasury reported that annual broad money, as measured by total deposits, increased by 20 percent, from $4.90 billion in March 2016 to $5.88 billion in March 2017.

Consequently, net claims to central Government increased by 40.2 percent to $4.034 billion in March 2017 as credit to the private sector decreased by 0.3 percent from $3.5 billion in March 2016 to $3.49 billion in March 2017.During the first quarter, the country received $180 million in Diaspora remittances through formal channels compared to $ 193 million in the corresponding period in 2016.
