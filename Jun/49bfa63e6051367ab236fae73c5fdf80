James GoddardSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Metropolitan Province needs to raise about $280 000 in the next two months to send a strong contingent to the rebranded Zimbabwe National Youth Games that will be held in Hwange in August. This year s games will mark the first time athletes will compete in 22 sport codes compared to eight since the inauguration of the Games in 2003.The new sport codes are rowing, swimming, rugby, hockey, cricket, pool, chess, darts, gymnastics, weightlifting, martial arts, cycling, table tennis and traditional games. These will be in addition to football, basketball, handball, tennis, volleyball, boxing, athletics and netballThe figure was revealed by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Nomthandazo Eunice Moyo during the unveiling of the new Bulawayo Metropolitan Provincial Sports and Recreation Committee board at the Bulawayo Polytechnic Hotel School on Thursday night. Our expectation to this new sports board is to mobilise resources for national events as required by the new National Sports and Recreation Policy, especially the upcoming rebranded Zimbabwe National Youth Games which will be hosted by Matabeleland North in August this year. I am reliably informed that the overall budget for Bulawayo to successfully send teams to these events is $276 146. Their immediate task is taking a contingent of 800 athletes and officials to Hwange for the 15th edition of the Games. These Games require a heavy budget, so as patron I call upon all of us to assist materially or financially in order for the province to give our youths this once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase their talent and be identified amongst the best in this country, said Moyo.She said with two months left before the Games, the board led by businessman and philanthropist Raj Modi needs to organise, set structures and mobilise resources.The board received a shot in the arm when Sports and Recreation Commission board member James Goddard donated $1 000 in cash, 100kgs of beef and 200 litres of fuel.According to the budget for Team Bulawayo, they need 12 buses, 16 utility vehicles, 3 600l of fuel, 800 tracksuits, 643 T-shirts, 184 golf T-shirts, 820 caps and 200 running vests.Part of the budget will go towards affiliation fees pegged at $80 per athlete and official, taking the affiliation figure to $64 000, while close to $100 000 is needed for the welfare of athletes and coaches.@skhumoyo2000
