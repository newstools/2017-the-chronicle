Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE newly formed Insiza District Women s Soccer League received a major boost after JM Busha Investment Group donated soccer balls, kit and training bibs worth $6 000. The league, which kicked off last week, was formed in March this year at Nkankezi Secondary School as part of the Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) plans to develop the women s game at grassroots level.Six teams, which include Nkankezi Secondary, Sebatha Secondary, JZ Moyo High, Filabusi Secondary, Mthwakazi Secondary and Sidzibe Secondary, will battle for the district title. ZWSL vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane said the donation by JM Busha Investment Group would go a long way in empowering the girl child. It s a big boost for this rural league and I believe this will go a long way in nurturing talent. We really appreciate the efforts of JM Busha to help us develop women s soccer in rural areas as part of their corporate social responsibility. I wish they (JM Busha) could do this in other areas where help is needed. I also hope the corporate world can follow what JM busha has done which makes a difference in rural communities, said Silengane.She said plans were afoot to launch a women s league in Matabeleland North. This is one of our pilot projects as Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League and we hope to see the girl child playing competitive football just like their male counterparts. There is a lot of potential in rural areas and we aim to nurture all such talent, she said.@khumzallen
