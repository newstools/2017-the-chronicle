Dr Karikoga KasekeKiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Tourism Authority is mulling implementation of a Command Tourism scheme as a way of increasing earnings from the sector.The command model has already been successfully implemented in the agricultural sector with the country expecting about 2,7 million tonnes of maize this year. Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the Hlanganani/Sanganai 10th anniversary launch at a Bulawayo hotel last week, ZTA chief executive officer, Dr Karikoga Kaseke, said the tourism sector was ripe for the implementation of Command Tourism.This year s Hlanganani/Sanganai World Tourism Expo will be held under the theme: Africa s Premier Business Exchange from September 27 to October 1. I am very serious about Command Tourism. We have heard lots of complaints about the things that affect tourism but if we have Command Tourism these things will be stopped and it must be commanded from the highest office of the President. If we say things that don t respect our tourism must be stopped I mean everything that does not respect our tourism must be stopped. If we say good pricing for a nation will boost our tourism so it must be implemented under Command Tourism. I am not advocating for price controls but we want good pricing that is attractive to tourists, said Dr Kaseke.He told Business Chronicle that the Command Agriculture model has proved to be a success hence the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry was geared to embrace the concept and have to table a draft proposal for Cabinet to approve.Dr Kaseke said if everything goes well, a Command Tourism scheme would be implemented early next year.Meanwhile, Dr Kaseke in his address to delegates who were drawn from different sectors, said Sanganai/Hlanganani should never leave Bulawayo and it is up to the local people to guard it jealously. People of Bulawayo have the right to host Sanganai and it is up to the city council and people to work together to keep and guard Sanganai jealously in order for it to help in redeveloping local tourism, he said.Dr Kaseke said Bulawayo should learn from Durban in South African which has managed to host the neighbouring country s tourism indaba year after year and derive more benefits from it.@Kiyaz_Cool
