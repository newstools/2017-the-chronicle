Showbiz Correspondent SKYZ Metro FM, Bulawayo s first commercial radio station which was supposed to hold an official launch last month has shelved those plans saying they want to celebrate a year on the air in style. Fair Talk Communications, the station s parent company chief executive officer Qhubani Moyo said there was no need to launch the radio station which started broadcasting live on September 11 last year as it was now popular. Skyz Metro has been accepted by the people so much so that launching it is problematic now. This is because some people won t understand why we re launching something that they ve accepted as their own. We d rather celebrate our togetherness, said Moyo.He said they were now putting all their energy into their one-year celebrations. The launch should also be a celebration of our first anniversary. We wanted to have the launch some time in winter, but we thought it wasn t the best time another reason why we opted for September as the celebration month as there ll also be so many activities around the Matabeleland provinces, he said.
