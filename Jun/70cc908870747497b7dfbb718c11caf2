This shows that we are a big player when it comes to Zimbabwe s politics, especially looking ahead to 2018 elections. We should be taken seriously and we re ready to grab power from Zanu-PF, said Mr Ndlovu. Those who know him know that he was a workaholic dating back to his days in Zanu-PF, his days as an independent and when he joined MDC-T. He will bring his workmanship to PDP. He said Mr Hlalo will hold a Press Conference tomorrow where he will explain why he joined the party.Mr Ndlovu said Mr Hlalo was joining the party as confirmation of their recruitment drive ahead of the 2018 elections. We are trying to be visible. People of Bulawayo are seeing our activities. We will continue to have those district meetings and rallies until we go for elections. We re doing the district meetings because we need to be visible on the ground. People will see us and we will explain to them our programmes so that they will understand why they should vote us into power. @nqotshili
