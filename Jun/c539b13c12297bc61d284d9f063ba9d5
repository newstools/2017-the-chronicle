Tendai ChikuniAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter Bantu Rovers FC 0-1 Chapungu FC CHAPUNGU recorded their first away win of the season by edging struggling Bantu Rovers in a Castle Lager Premiership match at Luveve stadium yesterday.Raymond Sibanda scored the solitary goal in the 57th minute with a well-taken free-kick from the edge of the box after Tinei Chitora had been felled by Munyaradzi Chitambwe.Sibanda curled his free-kick past diving Bantu Rovers goalkeeper Notice Dube into the top left corner of the net.Chapungu had been finding the going tough away from home, suffering three defeats and drawing the same number of games.Their coach Tendai Chikuni said the win came as a big relief. This is a big relief to us a team, as you know this is our first win away. We really needed this win because we have been getting draws away from home. It was a tough match against Bantu Rovers youngsters and we knew they will be confident after their draw against Ngezi Platinum Stars. The guys really did well after last week s performance against Dynamos, so this is an opportunity to pick ourselves up and look forward to our next match against Chicken Inn, said Chikuni.The first half was an end-to-end affair with both teams enjoying good spells, but failing to test the goalkeepers.The first real chance of the game fell to Chapungu in the 32nd minute, but Brighton Mugoni s left foot shot was saved by Dube.Rovers Newman Sianchali also had a chance from inside the box in the 43rd minute but lack of composure saw him skying his effort.Chapungu were more determined in the second half and created a number of chances, which they either fluffed or were stopped by the Rovers rearguard of David Mubaiwa, Tapiwa Kumbuyani, Dumisani Ndlovu and Fortune Sibanda.Mubaiwa was to receive a second yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Chapungu s Manuel Mavuto on the edge of the box after having earlier been booked for time wasting.Despite the loss, Rovers assistant coach Joseph Sibindi insisted that his charges were still work in progress. The game was fair and I think the boys really played very well. It s unfortunate that we are not getting the results that we want, but eventually we will get there. There has been a lot of improvement considering our previous games, Sibindi said.@khumzallen
