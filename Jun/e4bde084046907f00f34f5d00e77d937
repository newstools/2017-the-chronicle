Takesure ChinyamaLovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Dynamos and Legia Warsaw striker Takesure Chinyama has described himself as the Zlatan Ibrahimovich of Zimbabwean football after completing a move to FC Platinum last weekend. Former Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic (35), signed for the Red Devils last season and ended the season as the club s top goalscorer with 28 goals in all competitions.Chinyama, who turns 35 this year, returns to local football after a two-year absence during which he was playing for Polish Division Three side LZS Piotrowka.The former Orlando Pirates marksman was responding to questions about whether his injury would not have an impact on his performances for the platinum miners. People think they know about my injury, but no one really knows about it. I got injured on 23 May 2009 and people continue to talk about it, but now I do not listen to them. You can count from 2009 till now how many years. Am I not playing football? said Chinyama. Age is just a number. Why is it that you only want to check on Chinyama alone? Look at Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), he went to Manchester (United) at 35 and did he not deliver? Why can t you say Chinyama is the Zlatan of Zimbabwe? asked Chinyama rhetorically.He said he would prove his critics wrong when he turns out for FC Platinum, as he knows what is expected of him.FC Platinum take on Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab Stadium at the weekend. Coach Norman Mapeza said he is still assessing Chinyama s fitness before he can consider him for selection. @lavuzigara1
