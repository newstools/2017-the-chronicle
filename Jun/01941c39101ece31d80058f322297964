Minister Makhosini HlongwaneAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter SPORT and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane has bemoaned the lack of leisure studies among the country s tertiary institutions. Speaking at the launch of the 2016 Zimbabwe Report Card on the Physical Activity for Children and Youth at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) yesterday, Minister Hlongwane challenged the university to deepen its focus as far as the production of knowledge for sport, physical activity, sport and recreation and leisure studies is concerned. I really have to commend Nust for their role in producing knowledge in sport and physical activities. However, the whole area of leisure in Zimbabwe is a major skill gap. We don t have colleges in Zimbabwe that actually train leisure oriented studies. That is not helping us in skilling the Ministry of Sport and Recreation so that we can interact with all those involved in this important movement. That s one of the areas I want to challenge the institution to look at.Children have to go to the University of Venda in South Africa to do leisure studies but why should that be the case. We are one of the most literate people in the continent. Why should we fail to meet a major component of what we should be doing on a day to day basis? Minister Hlongwane said.The Report Card is a comprehensive summary of best available and current evidence regarding key indicators of physical activity such as participation in organised sports, active play, school, family, community and the built environment policy among children and youths.It was compiled by the Department of Sports Science and Coaching from Nust in collaboration with Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) and Active Healthy Kids Zimbabwe (AHKZ). @khumzallen
