DJs Crocx and OxygenAmanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter GWERU S Club Excite has taken over the city s night life. The club which was opened last year has positioned itself as one of the hottest nightspots in the Midlands province, spearheaded by Nelrocx Entertainment DJs Crocx and Oxygen.The DJs have undoubtedly been behind the success of the spot which attracts hordes of people weeklong as their vigorous marketing skills and talent on the decks are unmatched.Crocx and Oxygen said they had mastered the entertainment pattern in the city and used that knowledge to defeat rival clubs. There s always a misconception that Gweru nightlife is mainly driven by university students. We ve not only targeted students but the city s residents as well so that we have patronage when universities close, said Oxygen. Our strength has been on events as we make sure we host shows frequently so that revellers have diverse entertainment. In February, the club hosted Harare-based hip hop artiste, Takura and the shows were sold out.The duo revealed plans to make the club appealing to a national audience. We want the club to be a platform for interaction not just a spot for drinking and dancing. Also, we d want it to be known nationally so that it becomes a tourist attraction as people will be guaranteed that whenever they visit the City of Progress, there s a place that they ll be guaranteed of quality entertainment. Plans are underway for the club to host Winky D, Tytan and Jah Prayzah.@amanda49
