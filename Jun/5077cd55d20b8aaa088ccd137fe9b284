Kudzanai ChipangaWalter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent ALL roads will today lead to Masvingo s Mucheke B Stadium for the third Zanu-PF Presidential Youth Interface rally expected to be attended by more than 50 000 people. Zanu-PF s National Youth Executive led by Secretary Cde Kudzanai Chipanga toured the venue on Wednesday and expressed satisfaction with work that has been done at the stadium ahead of the rally to be held under the theme: Honouring Our Icon, Unlocking the Value in Youths. The Masvingo youth rally is the third one after two others held in Mashonaland East and Manicaland provinces. It is all systems go and we are only waiting for President Mugabe to arrive to meet youths in Masvingo, said Cde Chipanga. Masvingo provincial youth chairman Cde Nobert Ndaarombe hailed the national executive for giving the province support to hold the rally.He said youths in Masvingo are serious about the empowerment crusade, hence they deserve to benefit from every government programme for their survival. We want to praise the leadership of Cde Chipanga for closely monitoring progress on the rally. That also gave us motivation as we stood guided. Our party elders especially those in the Politburo like Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Senator Shuvai Mahofa, Mwenezi-Chivi Senator who is also Minister for Psychomotor Activities in Education, Cde Josiah Hungwe, deserve pats on their backs. They have been with us through and through, Cde Ndaarombee said.He also hailed Chivi Rural District Council Chairman Dr Killer Zivhu for donating $2 000 to buy meat to feed those coming to the rally.Cde Ndaarombe said Tongaat Hullet donated game meat and all the seven Rural District Councils in Masvingo donated money ranging between $300 and $500 while others supplied beef as well. &#8211; @walterbmswazie3&nbsp;
