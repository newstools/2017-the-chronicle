Dr Karikoga KasekeNhlalwenhle Ngwenya INSTEAD of being a provincial event, Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo has the potential to become a national event which can draw performances from Africa and attract tourists from all over the world, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) chief executive Karikoga Kaseke has said. A concerned Kaseke said if funding is availed, Intwasa could be the main centre of arts in the country. This is why his organisation has partnered Intwasa for this year s event with the hope to revive it and make it more appealing. Like any annual arts festival in the country, Hifa included, Intwasa s lackluster exhibition last year was attributed to financial constraints. This year, we re going to work hand-in-hand with Intwasa. I told the organisers of the festival that their event could be bigger than Hifa. That may not happen this year or next year, but with time they ll realise it. Intwasa should cease being a Bulawayo festival as we want it to entice tourists from all over the world. This year alone, no less than five countries should come for Intwasa, Kaseke said.One of the Intwasa organisers, Nkululeko Nkala said they were upbeat about their partnership with ZTA as it guarantees them that the festival will definitely take place this year. One thing for sure is that this year s festival is definitely happening despite the economic hardships we re facing. Thanks to the partnership with ZTA as they ll be paying for some of the acts that will perform at the festival, said Nkala.He said as a way to return the favour, the festival will also partner ZTA s Hlanganani/Sanganai travel expo which will run concurrently with Intwasa.Since it was formed 13 years ago, Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo has been a buoyant point of the city s culture. Workshops, discussions, crafts, fashion and various performances including comedy, theatre, dance and music take place as the arts momentarily colour the city of Kings and Queens.
