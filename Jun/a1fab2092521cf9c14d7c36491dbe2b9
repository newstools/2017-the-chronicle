Sunday ChidzambwaSikhumbuzo Moyo in Sun City, South Africa COACH Sunday Chidzambwa is taking the Warriors milestone 50th Cosafa Castle Cup match today just like any encounter, as putting so much historical significance into it might put his players under unnecessary pressure. Zimbabwe will this evening mark a record 50 Cosafa Cup matches since the tournament was first launched in 1997 and the Warriors lost their debut match 1-2 against Namibia.No other Cosafa member country has played more games and this evening s clash against Madagascar is a milestone in the history of the tournament and Zimbabwe.The Warriors have registered a record 32 wins and 83 goals after Monday s 4-0 demolition of Mozambique at Moruleng Stadium. I am not feeling the history part of it. It s something that I was not even aware of. I was and still am taking it as just like any other Cosafa game we are participating in and as coaches the most important thing we want or try to achieve is to win the game, regardless of its historical or archival importance, said Chidzambwa.He said his only worry was to win the game and get to the next stage, not because today s game marked 50 matches for the country in the tournament.Zimbabwe has won the tournament four times, first lifting it in 2000 before their second and third wins in 2003 and 2005 respectively.While the legendary Chidzambwa, who led the Warriors to their fourth Castle Cup triumph in 2009, believes today s 50th game is just but a number and another match, his team s co-captain Ovidy Karuru says it feels great to wear the armband in such a milestone event. It s a great feeling for me as a player, but I am not the only leader here, there is also Ocean (Mushure). I am just wearing the armband, but yes it feels great, said the AmaZulu player, who could be playing in the Absa Premiership next season.
