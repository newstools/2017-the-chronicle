Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A fierce Victoria Falls derby is in the offing this afternoon when Mosi Rovers and Amagagasi lock horns in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League at Chinotimba Stadium. The soccer crazy resort town will literally come to a standstill as both sides command a passionate following while the players will also be too eager to outwit each other for bragging rights.Attendance is likely to eclipse a number of Premier Soccer League encounters and it could be a huge pay day for the Victoria Falls Municipality which has failed to plough back proceeds from its share of the gate takings to maintain a proper playing facility.With a win each from seven and five matches respectively and massive points behind leaders Bulawayo Chiefs, the two sides know pretty well that a draw will do the town more harm than good in as far as bringing Premiership football is concerned because the gap will continue widening at the top.Zibonele Ncube, the Amagagasi coach lost a number of key players to elite clubs during the offseason after a fairtale run last season in which they were among the title contenders for the better part of the race but the new boys seem to be finding it hard to emulate last season s magnificent run. The former Fatima High School head boy must summon all his technical shrewdness if he is to steer Amagagasi back into contention.Last weekend Mosi Rovers held Blackboots to a one all draw in Bulawayo and that point on the road might spur them on into inflicting a fourth defeat to the white and black stripped Amagagasi.Three matches will take place in Bulawayo that will see Zim Leopards entertain Makomo, the first team to temporarily put a halt to Thulani Sibanda s Chiefs last weekend in Hwange while ZRP Bulawayo, just five points behind Chiefs are home at Fairbridge to Bosso 90 (or is it 91 now?). The law enforcement agents are slowly turning Fairbridge into a cauldron, having last lost almost a year ago against Makomo. Melusi Mabaleka Sibanda, the Bosso 90 coach must brace for a crude away trip.Talen Vision entertain Blackboots at Luveve and Dazzy Kapenya s Casmyn are hosting Victoria Falls Tigers.A mouth watering tie is on tomorrow at Harsfield when Bulawayo Chiefs host Indlovu Iyanyathela, themselves still very much in the championship matrix.FixturesToday: Zim Leopards v Makomo (White City), ZRP Byo Province v Bosso 90(Fair Bridge), Mosi Rovers v Amagagasi (Vic Falls), Casmyn v Vic Falls Tigers(Turk Mine), Talen Vision v Black Boots(Luveve).Sunday: Bulawayo Chiefs v Indlovu Iyanyathela ( Hartsfield)&nbsp;
