Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent MASVINGO has been hit by a diarrhoea outbreak with children under five years of age being the worst affected. Masvingo Provincial Medical Director Dr Amadeaus Shamu said: I can confirm that there are diarrhoeal cases that have been recorded in a number of health centres including council clinics this winter. It is unfortunate that I don t have the statistics with me here. These cases are common during the winter period because cold conditions are conducive for the thriving of the rotavirus, he said.Dr Shamu said the virus is easily spread in winter and causes inflammation in the stomach and intestines.He said from winter to early spring, the rotavirus can cause severe diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration in children who are five years old and below and some adults.Dr Shamu said children who have been vaccinated against rotavirus may still get it more than once.A nurse at Runyararo Clinic who asked not to be named for professional reasons said they receive more than three cases of diarrhoea each day. We normally experience outbreaks of diarrhoea involving young children and some adults at this time of the year. But this year there is an increase as compared with the previous year. We have hardly gone a day without treating three or more young children of diarrhoea. When it is too cold the number increases, she said. @walterbmswazie3
