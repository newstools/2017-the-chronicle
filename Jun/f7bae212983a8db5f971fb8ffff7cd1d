Also the minority white population reserved some sport codes for themselves.This was said by Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko when he launched the historic Community Sports and Recreation Club system at Nyamandlovu Primary School in Umguza district, Matabeleland North province yesterday.In order to correct the anomalous situation VP Mphoko said, Cabinet adopted the Community Sport and Recreation Club system and directed its immediate implementation. The national launch of the club system is the first of a series of events aimed at promoting the program which is a lifeline for the thousands if not millions of youths in Zimbabwe. The club system is expected to introduce organised sport and recreation in rural and formerly marginalised communities at the ward level throughout the country, said VP Mphoko.He said the clubs being formed will be complete with elected executives and constitutions to guide their operations. He added that it was a ground breaking institutional intervention that will provide clear career pathways for the previously disadvantaged youths and marginalised talent from the rural communities. Sport and recreation provide the lungs for a nation and must be taken very seriously by all institutions and stakeholders across the country. This club system we are launching today will not only contribute to the healthy life styles of our nation but will stimulate a massive grassroots sports economy of its own, in the form of kitting, infrastructure development and production of sport and recreation equipment, VP Mphoko told thousands of villagers who graced the occasion.The VP called upon established clubs to partner and mentor some of the newly formed clubs to provide leadership, development and experience. I am informed that these clubs will be given life in the form of the revised National Youth Games strategy, a crucial competition structure which now starts at the ward level leading all the way up to the national competition in a pyramidised structure starting at grassroots level. Let me commend the Ministry of Sport and Recreation, the Sport and Recreation Commission and other stakeholders for conceiving this game changing programme which I believe will unleash Zimbabwe s untapped talent on to the national, regional, continental and international stage, said VP Mphoko.The Minister of Sport and Recreation Makhosini Hlongwane, Provincial Affairs Minister for Matabeleland North Cain Mathema, senior government and sports ministry officials, acting director general for the Sports and Recreation Commission Joseph Muchechetere and traditional leaders attended the launch. @skhumoyo2000.
