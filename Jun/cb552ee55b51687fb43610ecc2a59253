Philip MarufuLovemore Zigara in Gweru Chapungu 1-0 Bulawayo City A strike by Philip Marufu deep into stoppage time earned maximum points for Chapungu in yesterday s Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Ascot Stadium.The result saw the airmen extending their unbeaten run to seven games without conceding a goal.City coach Mandla Lulu Mpofu was left cursing the football gods after managing to contain Chapungu for the better part of the game only to suffer the proverbial sucker punch when a share of the spoils seemed imminent. It s just unfortunate but this is how football is. It is sad that we lost three points today after playing so well and controlling the match into which I had thrown youngsters into the fray, said Mpofu. We need to work on our concentration, which saw us conceding in the last minute, but we are not demoralised and it s still a long way to go in terms of our survival mission, he said.Despite putting a lethargic performance, Chapungu gaffer Tendai Chikuni was happy that his side collected maximum points. Today we did not play our normal game, but I told the guys that after this (international) break anything can happen and so my worry was about consistency and I am happy we managed to get maximum points, said Chikuni.There was nothing much to write home about as there was little goalmouth action.Chapungu had two chances in the first half, but their strikers failed to convert and in the second half both sides also took turns to miss.City s best chance fell to substitute Rainsome Pavari, whose long range effort missed the upright in the 63rd minute.However, it was Chapungu who took the initiative thereafter following the introduction of Marufu, who came on for Ian Nyoni.With the match seemingly headed for a drab draw, Collen Kwaramba s throw in was flicked onto Marufu s path and he obliged with a tap in from close range, giving City goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya no chance.
