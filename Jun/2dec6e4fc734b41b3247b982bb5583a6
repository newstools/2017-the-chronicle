Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent ZIFA Bulawayo Province has summoned Mainline FC and Arenel Movers as well as match officials to explain circumstances that led to the abandonment of the two teams Division Two league match. Mainline were leading Arenel Movers 3-0 in the 87th minute when the match was called off after a pitch invasion by club officials at Dingumuzi Stadium in Plumtree on Saturday.Mainline use Dingumuzi Stadium and Figtree Stadium for their home matches. Mainline requested to use Dingumuzi Stadium and made the necessary arrangements with the visiting team and we (Zifa Bulawayo Province) then communicated with the referees to travel to Plumtree, said Zifa Bulawayo Province chairman Francis Ntuta.But in a surprising move, the match officials drove to Figtree Stadium instead of Dingumuzi Stadium only to find that both teams were nowhere to be seen. It s only after the match officials phoned the Mainline manager that they proceeded to Plumtree where the teams were awaiting kickoff. We understand that the match kicked off after 4PM, said Ntuta. As a result of the delay the match was abandoned a few minutes before the end because some club officials allegedly stormed the pitch protesting that their players were being affected by bad light. We have summoned both clubs and the match officials to explain what transpired and a decision to deal with the matter administratively or take it to our disciplinary committee will be made after the Friday meeting, he said.Mainline are 12th on the log with nine points from seven matches, while Arenel Movers are seventh with 11 points from the same number of matches.@RaymondJaravaza
