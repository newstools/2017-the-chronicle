Elvis The Bulawayo Bomber MoyoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HEAVYWEIGHT cage fighter Elvis Bulawayo Bomber Moyo returns to the ring for a potentially explosive bout against Britain s Stuart Austin at Sun City, Rustenburg, South Africa, next month. The South Africa-based Moyo last fought in March when he knocked out Mike Vermeulen at Carnival City in Johannesburg.Moyo s Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) Africa 61 bill is set for July 8 and the Zimbabwean is eager to beat the British fighter and take his Mixed Martial Arts career wins to nine.Moyo has eight career wins from 12 bouts. Even though it s been a while without a fight, I ve been working hard at the gym, doing sparring and working on my shortcomings. I m happy that I ve found a challenger in Austin, whom I know very little about. He has a judo background, but I don t think that will be a problem for me because what I just want to do is win, Moyo said.Beating Austin will enhance Moyo s chances of getting a title fight before the end of the year.Moyo lost to Andrew van Zyl in October 2016, but recovered from that defeat to knock out Vermeulen in two minutes 40 seconds in March this year. I stopped Mike (Vermuelen), who had gone for four matches without a loss, in March after getting him with one combination and I want to knock out Austin. Those who know me will tell you that I walk the talk and I m going to knock out Austin. I enjoy fighting, I train hard and when an opportunity to beat a person in the ring presents itself, I gladly take it. I ve shown that I m capable of beating the best and I feel I deserve a title fight. So winning against Austin is a must for me as that might get me a title fight shot, Moyo said.Austin has 11 career wins and three defeats. The Briton last fought in October last year, knocking out Nills van Noord in the UK.Austin last tasted defeat on May 14, 2016, when he went down to Mark Godbeer.@ZililoR
