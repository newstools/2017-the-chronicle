Wynne Zanamwe, Midlands Reporter THREE men from Mberengwa who stabbed a colleague, leaving him for dead after he mistakenly stepped on a dog belonging to one of them have been sentenced to a total of eight years imprisonment. Lordster Magogo (37) of Bherera Village, Nelson Sibanda (36) and Zvinavashe Mahohoma (26) both of Entumbane Compound in Mberengwa were charged with attempted murder which was altered to assault when they appeared before Regional Magistrate Mr Morgan Nemadire.The Magistrate convicted the trio against their plea of not guilty.Magogo and Mahohoma were sentenced to three years imprisonment each and a year was suspended on condition they each complete 410 hours of community service.Another year was suspended from each sentence for five years on condition the duo do not commit a similar offence and another year was suspended on condition they restitute the complainant $269.Sibanda was sentenced to two years imprisonment which is to run concurrently with a prison term which he is already serving.In passing the sentence Mr Nemadire said: I have considered that the three accused persons are family men who are still young. However it is aggravating that the three accused persons severely attacked the complainant for a simple mistake which could be easily resolved, he said.Prosecuting, Mr Kelvin Guvheya said on August 9 last year at around 8PM, the three accused persons and their colleague Moses Chuma were drinking beer at a bar in Mberengwa. The complainant mistakenly stepped over Magogo s dog and this angered him. Magogo stabbed the complainant twice with an okapi knife, on the right hand and once in the right eye. Mahohoma found the complainant bleeding from the eye and ordered him to buy some beer but the complainant did not respond, said Mr Guvheya.He said Mahohoma stabbed Mr Chuma with a knife once on his left rib and once in the left side of his chest.The court heard that Chuma fell down and while he was on the ground the trio kicked him all over the body. The complainant was rescued by his friend, Tinotenda Mutamiri, who took him to the police station. As a result of the assault the complainant sustained two deep cuts on the left rib, one on the left side of the chest and an injury on the eye, said Mr Guvheya.@wynnezane
