He spoke about the audition a lot and couldn t wait to hear whether he had got the part Thabo added.The casting director responsible for the audition said Jabu applied for the role of an irredeemable criminal who made his way out of prison after eight years and managed to track down his wife after she went into hiding in Limpopo. The audition went okay. He came in with a lot of energy and made the scene his by mere virtue of him not sticking to his dialogue. It felt like he was rushing through it and wasn t really as prepared as he could have been. For his lack of height, he was exactly the short ball of energy you see on television director Mandilakhe Yengo said.She said that Jabu left his audition with a huge smile.
