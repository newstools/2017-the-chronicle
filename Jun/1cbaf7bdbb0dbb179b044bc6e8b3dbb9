Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is encouraging schools to take up driving lessons and has lauded two schools in Matabeleland South that have embraced the initiative. Schools are encouraged to engage nearby VID depots so that pupils start driving lessons once they turn 16.The programme targeting Ordinary Level pupils is in line with the Life Orientation Skills Programme under the new education curriculum.The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr Sylvia Utete-Masango, said schools were slowly taking up the initiative. It s one of the technical vocational learning areas under the new curriculum and we actually implement that area in conjunction with VID. Schools have the curriculum framework, we are not prescribing but all we are doing is to make schools aware of some of the technical vocational areas that might not be the conventional one that they have apart from the old one, said Dr Utete-Masango. She said it was the prerogative of schools to engage VID for the lessons. It s not anything new, it s that they have to work with VID, they cannot teach that area without VID, said Dr Utete-Masango.She said two schools in Matabeleland South, Madlambuzi High School in Bulilima and Singwango High School in Filabusi swiftly took up the programme and are giving pupils driving lessons and facilitating road tests with the Vehicle Inspection Department. In Matabeleland South we have Madlambuzi in Bulilima that has been offering the learning area even before the new curriculum. Madlambuzi is over a 100 kilometres from Bulawayo and a stone s throw from Botswana but they have managed to take up the initiative to equip their pupils, said Dr Utete-Masango.
