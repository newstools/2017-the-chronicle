Musa MandazaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter VICTORIA Falls Tigers will be expelled from the Southern Region Division One Soccer League should they miss another league game. The side from the resort town have been walked over twice, against ZRP Bulawayo and Casmyn.Musa Mandaza, the Southern Region Division One Soccer League chairman warned Tigers and said they have since notified the club about the risk that they are facing.Kicking Tigers out will leave the Southern Region Division One Soccer League crippled, with 13 teams.Already the league lost Technosphere and Moto Moto who failed to register at the beginning of the season because of lack of resources. It s not our desire to lose teams because we want to maintain high level of competition and we don t want to compromise the standard of the game. However, rules are rules and if a club is walked over for three games, then they are out of the league. On Wednesday we instructed our administrator (Augustine Ndlovu) to alert Victoria Falls Tigers that they are just a game away from losing their First Division status. It is our hope that it will not come to that, said Mandaza.Tigers, on position 13 clash against anchors Black Boots in a bottom of the table encounter at Chinotimba Stadium today.Both sides have been struggling to move out of the murky relegation waters and are therefore hard-pressed to start collecting points.Another side that is staring relegation Chiwororo are away to Highlanders development side Bosso 90 at Luveve Stadium this afternoon.With Premiership games suspended for the weekend because of Warriors 2019 Afcon qualifier against Liberia, the clash between Bosso 90 and Chiwororo is likely to draw an appreciative crowd from Highlanders supporters eager to see their team s future stars.A victory for Bosso 90 will see them moving from position nine to eight, displacing Zim Leopards who are on a bye.For Chiwororo who are on position 11 with just four points, they are hard-pressed for maximum points so that they move away from the murky relegation waters.Another epic encounter is on cards at Fairbridge where championship contenders ZRP Bulawayo play host to fourth on the table Talen Vision.ZRP Bulawayo are second with 15 points, seven behind leaders Bulawayo Chiefs and a victory today will see them closing in on table-toppers who are at home to Mosi Rovers tomorrow.With third placed Casmyn on a bye, Talen Vision who have 13 points can leap to second position and dislodge ZRP Bulawayo if they beat the police force side.Perennial Southern Region Soccer League campaigners ZPC Hwange are at home to Amagagasi.Fixtures Today: Victoria Falls Tigers v Black Boots (Victoria Falls), Indlovu Iyanyathela v Makomo (HQ One Brigade), Bosso 90 v Chiwororo (Luveve), ZPC Hwange v Amagagasi (Hwange), ZRP Bulawayo Province v Talen Vision (Fairbridge)Tomorrow: Bulawayo Chiefs v Mosi Rovers (Hartsfield, 12PM) *all matches kick off at 3PM unless indicatedTable P W D L F A GD Pts Bulawayo Chiefs 8 7 1 0 17 2 15 22 ZRP Bulawayo 7 4 3 0 12 3 9 15 Casmyn 8 4 2 2 12 5 7 14 Talen Vision 8 3 4 1 8 4 4 13 Indlovu Iyanyathela 6 3 1 2 10 6 4 10 ZPC Hwange 5 3 1 1 5 1 4 10 Mosi Rovers 8 2 2 4 8 16 -8 8 Zim Leopards 8 1 4 3 15 15 0 7 Bosso 90 6 1 4 1 6 7 -1 7 Makomo 6 1 2 3 3 9 -6 5 Chiwororo 6 1 1 4 9 13 -4 4 Amagagasi 6 1 1 4 4 8 -4 4 Victoria Falls Tigers 6 0 3 3 3 11 -8 3 Black Boots 6 0 3 3 5 17 -12 3 @ZililoR
