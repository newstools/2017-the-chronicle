Ovidy KaruruSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AMAZULU winger Ovidy Karuru and seasoned Dynamos left back Ocean Mushure have been named the co-captains for the Zimbabwe squad that will take part in the Cosafa Castle Cup in South Africa next week. The squad will be trimmed to 20 this morning ahead of departure tomorrow by air to Johannesburg before the team connects by road to Northwest province where the tournament will be held. Karuru and Mushure will be our co-captains for the tournament. We looked at seniority and the ability to lead and we felt the two guys will complement each other, said team manager Wellington Mpandare.He said training has been going on well with all the players called up by the technical team reporting for camp. I must say the guys are looking forward to the tournament, they are raring to go and eager to lift the regional trophy, said Mpandare.Zimbabwe won the fourth and last of their Cosafa trophy eight years ago ironically under the tutelage of Sunday Chidzambwa, who leads the technical team and will be assisted by Lloyd Mutasa and Bongani Mafu.Chidzambwa guided Zimbabwe to the title on home soil eight years ago with a 3-1 victory over Zambia in the final and they were losing finalists to the same opposition in 2013. The Warriors suffered disappointing first round exit in 2015 and 2016.Ocean MushureFive of the players in the squad ply their trade in the Absa Premiership in South Africa while the rest are in the local Castle Lager League.Goalkeeper George Chigova (Polokwane City), defender Eric Chipeta (Ajax Cape Town), midfielders Ovidy Karuru (AmaZulu) and Michelle Katsvairo (Kaizer Chiefs), and striker Knox Mutizwa (Lamontville Golden Arrows), make up the contingent of players based outside of Zimbabwe.The selection of Mutizwa in particular will be exciting for fans after he excelled during a loan spell at Golden Arrows from BidVest Wits. He netted five goals in the second half of the campaign, including against both Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.Chidzambwa s selection was restricted to a point by the fact that the ZPL continues through the Cosafa Castle Cup tournament, meaning some players he might have liked to take to South Africa are not available.The coach has, however, been able to bring in-form Bantu Rovers striker Bukhosi Sibanda and Highlanders Prince Dube for the tournament, with the two Bulawayo lads having a combined 16 league goals this season, Sibanda netting 10 of them.The Warriors start their campaign on Monday against Mozambique at the Moruleng Stadium, before clashes with Madagascar at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on June 28 and Seychelles at the same venue on June 30.If Zimbabwe top their group they will face Swaziland in the quarterfinals on July 2, with the winner of that tie meeting either Namibia or Lesotho in the next round.Warriors Cosafa Cup Squad Goalkeepers: George Chigova (Polokwane City), Takabva Mawaya (Ngezi Platinum Stars), Talbert Mutombeni (Chapungu)Defenders: Eric Chipeta (Ajax Cape Town, SA), Ocean Mushure (Dynamos), Honest Moyo (Highlanders) Bruce Homora (Black Rhinos), Jimmy Tigere (Harare City), Jameson Mukombwe (Black Rhinos), Nyasha Mpofu (Shabanie)Midfielders: Liberty Chakoroma (Ngezi Platinum Stars), Gerald Takwara (FC Platinum), Ovidy Karuru (Amazulu, SA), Leeroy Mavunga (Yadah Stars), Talent Chawapiwa (FC Platinum), Michelle Katsvairo (Kaizer Chiefs, SA), Innocent Mucheneka (Chicken Inn), Collins Duwa (Shabanie)Strikers: Knox Mtizwa (Lamontville Golden Arrows, SA), Prince Dube (Highlanders), Bukhosi Sibanda (Bantu Rovers), Blessing Majarira (Herrentals), Raphael Manuvire (ZPC Kariba)Technical department: Sunday Chidzambwa (head coach), Lloyd Mutasa (assistant coach), Bongani Mafu (assistant coach), Thompson Matenda (fitness trainer), Admire Nyamadzawo (physiotherapist), Shingirai Binoni (kit manager), Dr Hillary Tshuma (team doctor), Wellington Mpandare (team manager).@skhumoyo2000
