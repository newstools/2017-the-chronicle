Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent ZANU-PF Bulawayo province has started organising funds to fulfil President Mugabe s pledge to donate cattle to the African Union (AU). Zanu-PF provincial chairman Cde Dennis Ndlovu said the province has set up a committee to mobilise resources which is chaired by the Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Cde Nomthandazo Eunice Moyo.Cde Ndlovu said the committee was set up during last Saturday s Provincial Coordinating Committee held at the party s provincial headquarters, Davies Hall. We ve resolved to start looking into the issue of the President s African Union cattle donation which all provinces are supposed to contribute to. The Minister of State for Provincial Affairs is chairing the committee that is tasked with the duty of mobilising resources in the province, said Cde Ndlovu. We want to get as many cattle as we can. We are not going to limit ourselves. What we know is that some of the provinces have already started mobilising the cattle and are raising big numbers. We ve organised ourselves and we will try and identify the individuals who are going to assist us in our endeavour. I m positive that we re going to do well. Cde Ndlovu said members are free to donate in cash or kind for the pledge to be fulfilled. President Mugabe has been hailed for his initiative to push for a self-reliant Africa and the cattle donation has been viewed as a step that should be emulated by other African states.During his tenure as the chairman of the AU in 2015, President Mugabe pushed for self-financing of the continental body so that 75 percent of locally mobilised resources go towards running AU programmes while 25 percent would be channelled towards peace-keeping operations.@nqotshili
