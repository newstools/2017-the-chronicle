Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter CIWU coach Kudzai Mhandire says his side is not looking further than their next game following a 3-0 drubbing of Mpopoma Pirates in a Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Two League clash at Bango on Saturday. Darlington Nyoni, Ashley Ndiweni and Elvis Tarabuka scored for CIWU.Following a disappointing showing last season during which they just managed to survive relegation, Mhandire seems to have turned his team s fortunes around, as they are presently second on the league table with 18 points. They are just two points shy of table toppers Toronto.While CIWU can be forgiven for having their eyes on the league title, Mhandire prefers to keep his side focused on the task at hand. We are running our own race and are looking at matches that we are featured in. We don t look at anybody else because if you look at somebody else, you tend to lose focus and neglect your responsibilities, said Mhandire. Our game was balanced and Pirates tried to come at us with power play, but we managed to catch them on quick breaks. Credit goes to the entire team, especially my goalkeeper, who made a number of saves, including a penalty. In a nutshell, our good pre-season preparations are paying off hence the big change in performance compared to last year. I m happy with how the team is progressing and we hope to continue getting good results, he said.In other matches played, Toronto cemented their dominance at the top of the table by thumping struggling CS Distributors 6-0.Lobengula Stars beat Saints Academy 2-0, while Khami United lost 0-1 to Chicken Inn.The match between Sabona Mzilikazi and Zenzele Tigers was postponed.Results Mainline 3-0 Arenel Movers, Sabona Mzilikazi v Zenzele Tigers (postponed), How Mine 0-2 Ajax Hotspurs, Mpopoma Pirates 0-3 CIWU, Lobengula Stars 2-0 Saints Academy, White Birds 4-0 LSU Utd, CS Distributors 0-1 Khami Utd, Khami Utd 0-1 Chicken Inn, Toronto 6-0 CS Distributors.P W D L F A Pts Toronto 8 6 2 0 24 7 20 CIWU 8 5 3 0 17 6 18 Ajax Hotspurs 8 5 2 1 15 8 17 Chicken Inn 8 4 3 1 13 7 15 Mpopoma Pirates 8 4 1 3 13 11 13 Lobengula Stars 8 4 0 4 15 11 12 Arenel Movers 7 3 2 2 12 9 11 How Mine 8 3 2 3 11 9 11 Zenzele Tigers 6 3 1 2 7 5 10 White Birds 8 3 1 4 15 17 10 Sabona Mzilikazi 7 2 3 2 13 10 9 Mainline Academy 7 2 3 2 9 8 9 Saints Academy 8 2 2 4 7 13 8 Khami Utd 8 2 0 6 9 16 6 LSU Utd 7 0 1 6 2 26 1 CS Distributors 8 0 0 8 4 23 0@khumzallen
