Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Reporter THE Local Organising Committee for the annual Beitbridge Mayor s half-marathon has asked the Beitbridge Town Council (BTC) to upgrade the race into a national event. In a preparatory meeting at the BTC chambers yesterday, most of the stakeholders were of the view that nationalising the event would apart from bringing in renowned athletes, help market the rapidly growing border town.The race, a brain child of Beitbridge town secretary, Loud Ramakgapola, was launched in July last year to raise awareness and boosting the community s capacity to deal with littering and environmental management issues.Ramakgapola said this year s race will be held on July 22 and that preparations had gathered momentum. We welcome the need to nationalise the event, considering that we are a transit town and bear the brunt in terms of littering and pollution. It is very critical that we open the race to many players as we seek to raise awareness on cross cutting environmental management programmes. You will note that we generate a lot of litter from both the residents and the transit population and hence the need for an integrated approach to issues around littering and pollution. The level of littering in this town is a grave matter of concern, said Ramakgapola.It is understood that the town with a population of 73 000 including 13 000 who are in transit daily generates 700 tonnes of solid waste per month. Ramakgapola said the half marathon will start at Lutumba Business Centre along the Beitbridge Masvingo highway, with the 12km race taking off from Chicago Village along the same road while the 5km walk will start at Masvingo turn.All races will end in the town s CBD. Registration has opened and we are targeting at least 300 athletes drawn from local residents and schools along the major highways leading to either Harare or Bulawayo. We also expect at least 3 000 residents including villagers on the same highways to participate in a two-day cleanup programme a day before and on the race, said Ramakgapola.He said the race will have three categories, including juniors (16 to 20 years), seniors (21 to 39 years) and veterans (40 years and above).Gilbert Mutandiro won last year s race which attracted 174 athletes.
