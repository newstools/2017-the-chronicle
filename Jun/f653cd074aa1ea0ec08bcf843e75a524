Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter Kwekwe City Council has failed to attract partners to resuscitate its brewery unit and abattoir after admitting that it can no longer afford to run the two entities. The local authority said the difficult economic conditions and limited financial resources had made it difficult to run the Kwekwe-Simba brewery and the abattoir.The council is battling with a salary backlog and the demand by workers for salary increments, resulting in it struggling to meet its obligations.It agreed with workers to lease the entities to private partners.Mayor Councillor Matenda Madzoke said from the tender they advertised earlier in March seeking partners to resuscitate the brewery and abattoir no company met the criteria. We had advertised that those interested in running the entities would be given five-year leases subject to renewal, proposed rentals for the facility and bids were submitted but the bids were not credible. A private partner which l cannot disclose once submitted the highest rental proposal and had succeeded but could not provide bank statements, so it failed, said Clr Madzoke.He said that since they have failed to attain partners they will have to re-advertise the tender.@amanda49
