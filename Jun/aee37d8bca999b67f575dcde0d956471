EcoCash reported this week that the payment solution was now live at 17 tollgates countrywide adding that measures were underway to roll out the system at other points elsewhere. The EcoCash payment solution is now live at 17 tollgates. However, Harare to Bulawayo, Bulawayo to Plumtree and Harare to Mutare EcoCash payment solution is coming soon, said EcoCash in a statement.Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive officer Mr Douglas Mboweni said the service would help motorists to experience the convenience of using EcoCash while providing Zinara with a safe, secure and convenient revenue collection method that will also help ease the flow of traffic at tollgates.EcoCash general manager, Mrs Natalie Jabangwe-Morris, said their main aim was to support the Government and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) s effort to ease the transacting process. Under this facility users can link a mobile phone wallet with a registered vehicle auto-detection and instant access at the tollgates. The auto-detection of the pre-loaded toll wallet at tollgate offers complete disruption to the manual payment method of cash and cards, saving motorists with queuing time with payment experience of under 10 seconds granting express toll access to motorists, she said.The company said to use the service customers need to register their Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) by following easy steps on their phones.The initial rollout covers 22 Miles, Chivi, Dema, Esigodini, Lutumba, Mashava, Mushangashi, Naude Quarry Site, Shamva, Shurugwi, Sino, Skyline and Umguza toll plazas with plans to spread out in future. @Kiyaz_Cool&nbsp;
