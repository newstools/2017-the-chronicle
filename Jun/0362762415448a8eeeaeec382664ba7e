Donald TrumpWashington President Donald Trump is beginning his day with a stream of tweets defending his record and lashing out at the investigation into Russian interference in the election. In a two-part tweet posted before 07:00 yesterday, Trump wrote: The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. He continued by saying: Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm . . . massive regulation cuts, 36 new legislative bills signed, great new SC Justice, and Infrastructure, Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works! Witch hunt is how Trump characterises the probe into Russia s election interference and possible ties to his campaign associates.Trump advisers describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation, yelling at television sets carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy.The special counsel overseeing the probe into Russia s alleged meddling in the US election is looking at whether Trump tried to obstruct justice, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed officials.In a pivotal shift in the investigation that has riveted Americans like no other in decades, senior intelligence officials have agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the Post said.It quoted five people briefed on the requests and said those who have agreed to be interviewed are Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and his recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett.The interviews could come as early as this week, the Post said.The newspaper s story was met with a furious reaction from Trump s personal lawyer and the Republican National Committee.The shift toward investigating the US president began days after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director on May 9, the Post said.The stated focus has been Russia s alleged efforts to tilt last November s presidential election Trump s way, and whether the winner s campaign was involved in any way.Trump vehemently denies any collusion between himself or any of his associates and Russia.Trump s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, issued a statement saying the FBI was behind the Post story and called the leak outrageous, inexcusable and illegal. The lawyer did not deny the story, however.Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel called the accusation in the Post unfounded and said it changes nothing . AFP
