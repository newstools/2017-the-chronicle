Golfers from Botswana, South Africa and Zambia are expected to be part of a strong field of 120 amateur golfers for the tourney that is targeting at raising $20 000.Proceeds from the tournament go towards assisting widows and dependants of the victims of the Kamandama Mine Disaster which claimed 427 lives on June 6, 1972 following a methane explosion.The tournament will be played in a four-ball better ball scoring format which consists of two teams of two players competing against each other.Each golfer plays their own ball throughout the round, such that four balls are in play. A team s number of strokes for a given hole is that of the lower scoring team member. It is also known as best ball or more properly better ball. We are finalising the preparations for the commemorations and we kick-start with the golf tournament which will be held on Monday followed by the memorial on Tuesday. We have set this year s target at $20 000, said Hwange Colliery Corporate affairs manager Rugare Dhobbie.She said the funds would be raised through donations from the coal mining giant s business partners who were sponsoring a variety of goods which would be auctioned during the tournament.Draw sheetType of competition: Stableford hidden partnerFirst tee8:00 M Moyo, C Lungu, P Sibanda, M Phiri8:06 V Ncube, T Ncube, C Chiodas, M Gorerino8:12 E Moyo, B Nekatambe, A Lungu, T Mwapamba8:18 G Phiri, S Tshamala, S Musengi, ZW Chihowa8:24 ST Makore, 1 Nousenga, V Suerga, TBA8:30 R Munangwa, L Gumisa, CK Chimiti, Dr Ngorora8:36 K Chimiti, W Mwale, V Moyo, M Magidi8:42 A Zakeyo, A Mandoza, TBA, C Chipaya10TH TEE8:00 C Kolosa, LMadyegaswa, J SHoko, G Nyoni8:06 P Utete, L Machiwana, J Nyasulu, T Tshamala8:12 MT Moyo, E Mupfiga, V Musengi, S Mabena8:18 G Katsidzira, S Gwanonga, A Ncube, M Langa8:24 J Manama, S Mukundu, P Papayi, S Makoni8:30 O Mpala, J Gurani, B Mafuba, M Gwesu8:36 G Sibanda, K Zulu, E Nyasulu, A Ndebele8:42 S Phiri, S Manamike, D Mbirikira, J Zulu @skhumoyo2000
