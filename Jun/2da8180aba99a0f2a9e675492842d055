You committed a serious offence which calls for a deterrent sentence. You had seven people on board who were injured because of your negligence. These people could have died as a result of your actions, said Mr Mawere. We want the world to see that we don t condone such acts and the sentence I will give you should be a lesson to likeminded people. Putting people s lives at risk is a serious offence. Prosecuting, Mrs Rose Sibanda said the incident occurred on February 20 at around 7AM. On 20 February Dube was driving a Granvia vehicle along the Bulawayo-Kezi Road headed for Bulawayo with seven passengers on board. Upon reaching the 50 kilometre peg he failed to negotiate a curve and the car overturned twice before landing on its side. Dube and the seven passengers who were on board sustained injuries of varying degrees, said Mrs Sibanda.She said the matter was reported to the police resulting in Dube s arrest.Mrs Sibanda said Dube was negligent as he failed to keep the vehicle under control, failed to act reasonably when an accident seemed imminent, was travelling at an excessive speed and had failed to maintain a proper look out.In mitigation, Dube said he was not sure what caused him to lose control of the vehicle. He said he recalls driving and thereafter his mind went blank.@DubeMatutu
