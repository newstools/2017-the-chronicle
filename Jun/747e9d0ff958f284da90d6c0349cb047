Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE business sector has been challenged to plough back to communities they operate from and support the vulnerable who are struggling to make ends meet. Bulawayo businessman Mr David Moyo said this while handing over food hampers to the elderly, widowed and child headed families in Nkulumane suburb on Saturday.Mr Moyo who runs Fulgens Enterprises said economic challenges should not deter the business sector from lending a helping hand to communities. We are having this donation solely because we run supermarkets in this suburb and we have decided to plough back to the community that has been supporting us over the years through giving food to the aged, orphans, disabled and widows, said Mr Moyo. One has to understand that this group of people is less privileged and can hardly afford to cater for themselves especially during these hard economic times and as such we have decided to assist by at least ensuring that they get a decent meal. he said.Mr Moyo s donation consisted of mealie meal and sugar which was handed over to the vulnerable who were selected by the residents.Bulawayo United Residents Association s ward 20 chairperson Mr Paul Ngwenya hailed Mr Moyo for his benevolence and challenged other business people to emulate him. To us as residents this is something we are grateful about.
