It hasn t been easy because the young squad we have took time to gel after we lost a number of seasoned players at the beginning of the year.

We just need a couple of experienced players to steady our ship while the youngsters we brought into First Division with get experience. The youngsters also need to understand that we re now in a different level, change mindset and work harder than what we ve been doing if we re to start collecting points, said Morris Mukwiti, Chiwororo s coach.While Chiwororo were left licking their wounds after the weekend games, Zim Leopards, who are also in their debut season in Division One, pulled a shocker, beating Talen Vision 2-1 at White City Stadium.Leopards got their goals from Marvin Dube and Michael Bhebhe, while Vision, who probably underrated their opponents, scored their consolation through Mongameli Ndlovu.Leopards moved a place up the ladder to ninth place tied on 11 points with eighth-placed Indlovu Iyanyathela.Bosso 90 made a giant leap up the table from sixth to third with 16 points following a 3-2 win over Black Boots.
