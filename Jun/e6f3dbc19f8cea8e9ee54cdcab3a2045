Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent THE Southern Region Women s League will kick-off this weekend with a total of 10 teams set to take part in the 2017 season. The league welcomes three new Ntabazinduna-based clubs, Sojini, Madlelenyoni and Hlambabaloyi, together with Barrow Jets and Ubuntu Queens.They will join Highlanders Royals, school-owned teams Magwegwe Stars and Sobukhazi, police bankrolled side ZRP Bulawayo Province and Black Boots in the second season of the revived Southern Region Women s League.If negotiations with the United College of Education (UCE) and Hillside Teachers College are fruitful, the league could also welcome two more teams to bring the total to 12.Affiliation fees have been pegged at $150 per club. After the departure of a number of our teams to the newly formed Premier League, we are glad to say the void has been filled by a number of new teams and the 2017 season will kick off on Saturday. It s also interesting to note that we have been joined by three clubs from Ntabazinduna, which is not far from Bulawayo, so teams will not experience challenges travelling to fulfil matches, said league chairman Takundwa Chimundiya.Seasoned clubs such as Inline Academy, Hearts of Oak, New Orleans and little known Street Sets joined the Premier League and play against top teams from cities and towns across the country.Highlanders Royals had also been roped into the Premier League, but the club resisted the move citing financial constraints that come with travelling to fulfil fixtures. @RaymondJaravaza
