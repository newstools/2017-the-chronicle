Showbiz Reporter A BATTLE of the DJs will be held at Nkulumane s Umqombothi Sports Bar on Saturday to find a wheel spinner in Bulawayo who will become a resident DJ at the nightspot. Over 20 DJs have signed up for the battle which will be led by DJ Sweeto, the bar s head DJ.Renowned DJs Mzoe, Emity Smooth, Phat Joe and Josh will be judges. Each DJ will be given 10 minutes to show off their song selection, mixing and beat matching until we get to the final, said Umqombothi spokesperson Zandile Moyo. The judges will choose a top three and eventually the winner. Whoever wins will be offered a contract to work at Umqombothi full time. Depending on their performance, the contract might be for a long time, said Moyo.On what is expected of the DJs, Moyo said: We re looking for someone who ll be able to gel well with our Umqombothi crowd. They must have a vast knowledge of music and be presentable. Hopefully, those who ll be there will capture what we want as a nightspot. The competition seems to be stiff as already 20 DJs have signed up. She said those who wanted to participate were still welcome. All they have to do is send a 10 minute mixtape to DJ Sweeto through Bluetooth or WhatsApp on his number 0717898962 showing off their skills. If they impress him, they ll be entered into the competition, said Moyo.During intervals throughout the competition, DJs Cool Jeff, Phibz and Sheriff will entertain patrons.
