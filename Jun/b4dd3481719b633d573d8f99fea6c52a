Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter SHURUGWI Town Council has entered into a public-private-partnership with private land developers to service land that will have more than 1 600 residential stands. The council chairperson Mr Tsungai Makore said the local authority was working with four construction companies to service the land and the stands will be sold to civil servants and other home seekers from the mining town. We have engaged private land developers who include Shesham, Pevmark, December 12 Housing Development and JM Construction to service the land, he said.Mr Makore said houses to be built on the new land will go a long way in reducing the council s housing waiting list, which he said stands at about 3 000.He said only those on the council s housing waiting list will benefit from the housing project.Mr Makore said beneficiairies will be allowed to build houses once they pay a third of the price of the stands whose sizes range from 300 to 2 000 square metres.A 300 square metre stand costs $6 200, 400 square metres is pegged at $8 200 and 2 000 square metres is selling for $15 000.Mr Makore said servicing involved building roads, putting up water and sewer reticulation systems among other facilities. We are playing our part as a council to complement Government in housing delivery, he said.Mr Makore commended Unki Mine for the partnership, which he said had changed the socio-economic activity of the mining town.The mine last year completed construction of 950 houses for its employees at the 1 105 hectare Impali Source Farm.@Amanda49
