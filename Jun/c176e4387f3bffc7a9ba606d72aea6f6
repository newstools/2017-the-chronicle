The need to remove interest on unpaid amounts for Government was noted, reads the report.However, concern was raised on Victoria High School and Helen McGhie Primary School over their outstanding unpaid rates and it was resolved that water supplies be suspended to these two institutions. It was resolved to recommend that the city treasurer be instructed to disconnect water supplies to Victoria High School and Helen McGhie primary School for non-payment of water and other service charges. It was also resolved that the Town Clerk Mr Adolf Gusha be instructed to set up a debt management team whose mandate would be to formulate and strengthen debt management and revenue collection strategies in council.
