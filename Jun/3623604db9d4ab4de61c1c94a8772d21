&nbsp;Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS are not happy about the last minute cancellation of their Intercity Rugby League (ICL) match against Old Hararians which was meant to take place at Hartsfield today. Themba Phiri, the Highlanders Rugby Football Club chairman expressed his annoyance with Zimbabwe Rugby Union vice president who is in charge of ICL, Nody Kanyangarara over the cancellation of the fixture because transport could not be secured for OH to make the journey from Harare to Bulawayo.Phiri revealed that he only got a message via WhatsApp from Kanyangarara about the calling off of the fixture on Thursday evening which he described as painful because they had spent a lot of money preparing for the match against one of the top sides in the country. I am not happy with the level of organisation, we are told at the 11th hour. We know there are challenges but they should tell us when there is time so that we can make other plans. We have spent a lot of money preparing for this fixture, this was a big game so the way we prepare for it is different, said Phiri. If the match had gone ahead, Highlanders had an opportunity to parade their new playing kit which was recently donated by their former players who are based in South Africa as well as overseas.The George Mukorera-coached side will now have to wait a little longer before they can use their new uniform.Fixtures sent out by ZRU yesterday show that only three fixtures are taking place in the ICL today.Matabeleland Warriors clash with Police Defenders at Hartsfield, Gweru Sports Club are at home to Old Miltonians while Harare Sports Club welcome Mutare Sports Club.The other match which has been put on hold due to transport challenges was supposed to be between Old Johanians and Bulldogs. It is understood that Police Defenders are using their own resources for the journey, the same with OMs and Mutare. Log leaders Old Georgians have a bye in the 11-team league. @Mdawini_29.
