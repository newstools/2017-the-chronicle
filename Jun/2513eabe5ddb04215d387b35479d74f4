Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZPC Munyati s 11-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end at the weekend in a 0 1 defeat to Ivan Hoe in a Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) encounter. The Kwekwe derby had all the ingredients of a thriller as a capacity crowd that would make some Premiership clubs green with envy witnessed the encounter at Amaveni Stadium.Ivan Hoe captain Elton Njanji ensured the home team secured maximum points and bragging rights with a first half strike.It was also a match which saw the return of ZPC Munyati coach Isaac Nyabvure to Amaveni Stadium for the first time after he quit Ivan Hoe and took seven players with him to the power generators.The win left Ivan Hoe on 23 points and within a point of log leaders Tongogara, who were held to a goalless draw by FC Platinum Under-19.Julius Chakupewa, the Ivan Hoe coach, paid tribute to his charges for containing ZPC Munyati. It was a closely fought encounter which I am happy we emerged unscathed. Our game plan worked to perfection and we managed to restrict ZPC Munyati to countable raids, said Chakupewa. They, however, had a good second half, especially during the closing stages, but they made too many mistakes because time had run out. Overall it was a good match with commendable sportsmanship by both teams, he said.Nyabvure conceded defeat. The better team on the day won. You know it is always difficult to win against your former club, especially when the core of the team is players whom you would have coached before, said Nyabvure.Elsewhere, Whawha maintained pressure on the early pacesetters with a 4 2 win over Shurugwi-based Makusha, while MSU s winless run extended to three matches after they fell 2 3 to TelOne in a Gweru derby.Results: MSU 2-3 TelOne, Chrome Stars 3-0 Gwanda United, Ivan Hoe 1-0 ZPC Munyati, ZRP Gwanda 0- 0 Blanket Mine, Whawha 4-2 Makusha, Vumbachikwe 2-2 Black Eagles, FC Platinum Under-19 0-0 Tongogara, Silo United 3-0 Border Strikers.@lavuzigara1
