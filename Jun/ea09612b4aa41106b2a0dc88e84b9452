Musa MandazaRaymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent ZIFA Southern Region is following developments in the inaugural Binga Division Two League with keen interest, as the champions will join their Division One League in 2018. The Binga Division Two League is made up of 12 teams from the district and kicked off a fortnight ago.The new league was initiated by businesspeople and club owners from Binga District as well as the Mat North Province Division Two League committee with the primary objective of spreading professional football to the Binga community.2017 winners of the Binga Division Two League will represent Binga district in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League next season. Because winners of the new Binga league will join us (Zifa Southern Region) next year, it s imperative that we give them all the necessary support so that they run their league professionally and effectively. We will be paying a courtesy call on Binga to see how they run the new league and make recommendations where we feel there are shortcomings, said Zifa Southern Region league chairman Musa Mandaza. The birth of a professional league in Binga is not only good for football in the region, but the country as a whole and we want to see them succeed. The Zifa Southern Region technical committee, a body tasked with training referees, coaches and administrators, will draw up a training programme targeting the new Binga league. We want to make sure that before the end of July, our technical committee trains coaches and referees from Binga to equip them with the relevant skills, Mandaza said.@RaymondJaravaza
