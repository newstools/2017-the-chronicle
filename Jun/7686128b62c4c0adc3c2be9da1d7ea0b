Four points separate the top team Black Rhinos, who have amassed 27 points, and eighth placed ZPC Kariba.The few points difference between the top eight teams have made the championship race interesting with no clear championship favourite yet.This means that the teams which are in the title race cannot afford to drop points as doing so could see them lose grip in the contest.By the end of today s fixtures, leaders Black Rhinos who are in action tomorrow may find themselves either in position two or third on the table.Chicken Inn v Ngezi Platinum Stars (Today, Luveve Stadium): It s a stern test for 2015 champions Chicken Inn who are third on the table tied on 27 points with leaders Rhinos and Ngezi Platinum. The platinum miners are the most lethal side in the league, scoring 23 goals in 14 outings. Chicken Inn on the other hand have a joint-second best defence with FC Platinum which has conceded five goals. The most watertight defence is that of Rhinos that has let in four goals in 13 games.Chicken Inn come into today s game with their heads high as they enjoy a five-match winning streak. Beating Ngezi Platinum will take their tally to 30 points, three ahead of Rhinos who play Harare City tomorrow.A win for Ngezi Platinum can also take them to the top.Chicken Inn and Ngezi Platinum can move above Rhinos only for 24 hours in the event that they draw.Ngezi Platinum who were held to a 2-2 draw by Bantu Rovers go to Luveve Stadium without utility player Liberty Chakoroma and goalkeeper Takabva Mawaya who are in South Africa with Warriors Coasafa Cup squad. They are also said to be missing the services of injured central defender Patson Jaure. Chicken Inn will only miss midfielder Innocent Mucheneka who is on national duty.Players expected to carry the day for Chicken Inn include goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze who has kept five consecutive clean sheets, defenders Moses Jackson, Guide Goddard, Divine Lunga and Passmore Bernard.The midfield quintet of Clemence Matawu, Tafadzwa Kutinyu, Thabani Goredema, Chris Samakweri and George Majika as well as favoured forward Darryl Nyandoro complete Chicken Inn s team likely to start.Ngezi Platinum s hopes will be pinned on goalkeeper Nelson Chadya, midfielders Xolisani Moyo, Dominic Mukandi and Walter Mukanga and offensive players Donald Teguru, Clive Augusto and Terrence Dzukamanja.FC Platinum v Tsholotsho FC (Today, Mandava): FC Platinum s 13-match unbeaten run in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League might count for nothing in the championship race unless they start turning draws into wins.The platinum miners are seventh on the table with 23 points from 13 outings and last weekend drew their eighth match of the season, a 0-0 stalemate with ZPC Kariba.Being the only unbeaten team in the league, the platinum miners face rock bottom Tsholotsho FC side who are still hunting for their first victory of the season.The odds favour FC Platinum with a victory taking them to position four.How Mine v Highlanders (Tomorrow, Barbourfields): This is a match that Highlanders will want to maintain their dominance while the gold miners will be searching for their third win over Highlanders.In their last eight meetings, How Mine have won twice, 1-0 and 2-1 in 2013 during their maiden PSL season. Since then, Highlanders have won four times, drawing twice.Highlanders and How Mine are tied on 24 points, with the former sitting on position four because of a superior goal difference.Bosso who bounced back to winning ways last week, beating Hwange 3-0 a week after losing by the same scoreline to Rhinos need to be at their best to beat How Mine who have gone for four games without a defeat.How Mine coach Kelvin Kaindu said they will miss utility player Thembani Masuku, defensive pair of Nelson Tachi and Brian Mbiriri through injury.They welcome back Milton Ncube who missed their 2-1 win over Yadah FC because of suspension. I believe this will be an exciting game and the best team of the day will win. They have good youngsters with flair as well as seasoned players so we expect a great game. Hopefully we will be able to continue with our good run, Kaindu said.Bosso who are without striker Prince Dube and leftback Honest Moyo who are participating at the Cosafa Cup are likely to include regulars Rodreck Mutuma, Tendai Ngulube, Allen Gahadzikwa, Simon Munawa and Benson Dube who missed the Hwange game.The youngsters likely to be retained include defender Bukhosi Ncube, midfield pair of King Nadolo and Brian Banda as well as striker Godfrey Makaruse.FixturesToday: Chicken Inn v Ngezi Platinum (Luveve), FC Platinum v Tsholotsho FC (Mandava)Tomorrow: How Mine v Highlanders (Barbourfields), Bantu Rovers v Chapungu (Luveve), Triangle United v ZPC Kariba (Gibbo), Hwange v Shabanie Mine (Colliery), Black Rhinos v Harare City (Morris Depot), Dynamos v Bulawayo City (National Sports Stadium)Tuesday: Yadah FC v Caps United (Morris Depot) -@ZililoR
