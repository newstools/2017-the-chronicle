The agenda of the meeting was to address issues in the province. A group of about 50 uninvited youths led by the accused entered the meeting. He shouted, Imimi naKasukuwere mauraya musangano! (You and Kasukuwere have destroyed the party) and went on to poke the complainant in the eye using his forefinger, said Mr Dlodlo.The court heard that Ngwenya, who had attended the meeting, stood up and slapped Charumbira once on the cheek. A misunderstanding ensued between the two over the presence of Charumbira and his group. This resulted in Ngwenya slapping Charumbira once in the face. Ngwenya then fled from the scene soon after committing the offence, said the prosecutor.Last month, Bulawayo provincial war veterans chairman Cephas Ncube, three war veterans and three Zanu-PF youths including Charumbira were involved in violent skirmishes when rival groups fiercely clashed during the party s provincial co-ordinating committee (PCC) meeting.Ncube (59) of Nketa 8 suburb and fellow war veterans Juliet Sibanda (55) of Magwegwe North, Luke Mpofu (64) of Nkulumane and Abigail Nyamunda (53) of Tshabalala are facing assault charges following the chaos at the party s headquarters.Ncube is also separately charged for indecent assault after allegedly fondling Zanu-PF Bulawayo provincial youth league Chairperson Cde Anna Mokgohloa.The ruling party s youths Davies Muhambi (35) of Burnside, Mabutho Moyo (32) of New Luveve and Charumbira of Trenance are facing charges of malicious damage to property.Youths and war veterans laid an almost six-hour siege at the hall while Central Committee members, Politburo members, provincial executives and legislators were holed up inside.Anti-riot police had to be called to the party offices to control some youths who were trying to stop the executive from holding the meeting accusing the provincial leadership of supporting national commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere.Muhambi, Moyo and Charumbira are accused of throwing stones and damaging window panes at Davies Hall during the scuffle.@cynthiamthembo1
