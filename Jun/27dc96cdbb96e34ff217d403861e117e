Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO boxing fans will be treated to exciting bouts when the Bulawayo Amateur Boxing Association (Baba) holds a tournament at Sizinda South Beer Garden today. Pugilists from Gwanda, Victoria Falls and Bulawayo clubs HQ Brigade, Sikhulile, Nkulumane, Inyanda, Njube, Nketa and Tshaka will compete in different categories which include cadets, juniors, youth and elite.Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) technical-director Steven Masiyambumbi said the competition is meant to prepare boxers for a national competition to be held in Kwekwe on June 24. This is our third competition as Bulawayo province and this time we want to prepare boxers for a national tournament which will be held later this month in Kwekwe. This competition will also give us a platform to assess our fighters as we prepare for the National Youth Games which will be held in Matabeleland North in August, said Masiyambumbi.He said he has been impressed with the talent that has been showcased in the previous competitions which the province held early this year. The talent is there in the province and as administrators we have a big task of ensuring that the same talent doesn t go to waste. That is why you see that whenever we select a national team, there are always guys from Bulawayo, he said. @khumzallen
