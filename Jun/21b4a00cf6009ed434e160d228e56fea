This is because SPAR operates under voluntary trading principles, encouraging retailers to take full advantage of SPAR s structure which is not a franchise.SPAR is made up of 33 locally owned independent retailers across the country. The retailers apply to become members of a Guild of SPAR Grocers, who in turn elect a Guild committee annually (made up of retailers and wholesalers) to administer and protect the interests of the SPAR brand and its member retailers, together with formulating brand strategy.
