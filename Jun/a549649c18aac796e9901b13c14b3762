Ovidy KaruruSikhumbuzo Moyo at Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace, South Africa Zimbabwe 0- 0 Madagascar THE Warriors technical team s gamble to throw in Blessing Majarira in the starting line-up against Madagascar at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace yesterday backfired, as the 28-year-old Herentals forward struggled in his second match for the national team.Majarira was one of the scorers in the Warriors 4-0 demolition of Mozambique in their opening Group B match on Monday after coming in as a second half substitute.Despite being robbed by match officials, who denied the four-time Cosafa Castle Cup winners two clear cut spot kicks late in the second half, the Warriors were largely a pale shadow of the team that walloped Mozambique at Maruleng Stadium.The boys only came to life after Knox Mutizwa was brought in for Majarira at the beginning of the second half.A forced substitution for the injured Jameson Mukombwe might also have disturbed Zimbabwe s plan as they were forced to push Jimmy Tigere into the right-back position, with Bruce Homora coming in to partner Erick Chipeta in central defence. The pace might have been too fast for Majarira, but that does not make him a bad player. We thought he will give us that stamina, but it didn t happen, said Warriors assistant coach Bongani Mafu during the post match press conference.The game was a very physical encounter, but credit must be given to Gerald Takwara, who managed to match the Malagasy physical approach to the game.After the introduction of Mutizwa, Zimbabwe started probing their opponents as they searched for a killer goal, and with a bit of luck, captain Ovidy Karuru could have scored his third goal of the tournament, but his header was somehow blocked for a corner by alert Madagascar goalkeeper Jean Randrianasolo.The goalkeeper was again called to go airborne to punch Mutizwa s sliced header back into play, as the Warriors smelled blood.Four minutes before full time, skipper Karuru and the entire Zimbabwe squad thought they had won themselves a penalty after he was fouled by the advancing Madagascar goalkeeper, but Botswana referee Joshua Bondo awarded a goal kick. From where we were, that was a penalty, but it didn t happen. We, however, did lose the game, but we are not happy to have drawn, although we are still breathing in the tournament, said Mafu.The Warriors take on Seychelles in their last group game tomorrow where defeat is not an option if they entertain chances of meeting Swaziland in the quarter-finals on Sunday.&nbsp;
