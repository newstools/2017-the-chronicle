Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls HOME Affairs Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo and his Tourism and Hospitality Industry counterpart Dr Walter Mzembi are set to meet on Monday to bring to finality the thorny issue of too many roadblocks on the country s highways. For some time there have been complaints about the high number of roadblocks on the country s roads. The Government last week promised to reduce the number of standard roadblocks to four per province.A standard roadblock has a Police Ahead sign, drums and flashing lights. Government further clarified that spot checks by police within cities and towns will remain in place.Speaking to journalists in Victoria Falls on Thursday, Dr Mzembi said: I am satisfied with the response to my plea. When I came back I made a promise to take the matter head-on but I didn t argue emotionally. I am meeting Minister Chombo on Monday. He is visiting my office where we will be taking the issue in a scientific manner to come up with a very balanced decision that satisfies security issues as well as legitimate travel. Tourists and motorists have previously raised concerns about numerous roadblocks in the country.Dr Mzembi said the issue should be handled with caution as the issue of security overrides all other matters. Tourism is secured by the security cluster. I have heard their arguments and we must do it in a manner in which we protect the destination without compromising security, he said.In addition to reducing the number of roadblocks, Government is also planning to unveil an electronic traffic management system to integrate all transport stakeholders like the police, the Vehicle Inspection Department, the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration, the Road Motor Transport and the Central Vehicle Registry to bring to an end traffic management challenges. @ncubeleon
