Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter THE number of elephants that have died due to suspected cyanide poisoning at Hwange National Park has risen to eight and police have since arrested three suspected poachers. A container containing cyanide was found two weeks ago in the same area within the national park where elephant cyanide poisoning was first reported in 2013 leading to the death of more than 300 jumbos.Hloniphani Sibanda (23), Charlston Sibanda (270 and Heritage Ncube (21) of Siphoso area under chief Siphoso in Tsholotsho have been arrested.Another suspect Dyker Ncube also of Siphoso area is still at large.The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) acting spokesperson Mr Simukai Nyasha said eight elephants have died so far. A total of eight elephants have succumbed to suspected cyanide poisoning in Hwange National Park. A container with suspected cyanide liquid was discovered on May 31 along an elephant track at Kennedy 1 in Hwange National Park. After intensive investigations and patrols in the surrounding areas of Hwange National Park, a raid by Zimparks and police officers at several homesteads in Lilongwe village in Tsholotsho led to the arrest of three suspects and discovery of a 2 kg ivory piece, 100 grammes of cyanide granules, 1 kg of dagga and African gin (thothotho), he said.Mr Nyasha said the ivory piece and cyanide granules were stashed under a bed inside a hut which was occupied by the three suspects who were immediately arrested. The owner of the homestead, Dyker Ncube managed to escape and he is still at large. We first discovered two elephant carcasses with missing ivory in the general area of Liasha in the southern border of the Park and this prompted Zimparks to engage a local hunting operator Lodzi Hunters for assistance with a helicopter for aerial patrols and this led to the discovery of six more carcasses within the same, he said.Mr Nyasha said the Environmental Management Agency has already decontaminated all affected areas.A police source said the anti-poaching team raided the suspects homes resulting in the discovery of ivory and cyanide in one of their bedrooms.Poaching is a big challenge in the country, with some poachers resorting to poisoning animals.At least 300 elephants died due to cyanide poisoning in 2013.@winnie_masara
