Second-placed ZRP Bulawayo are inactive this weekend and Chiefs, who top the table with 28 points from 10 matches, will be out for maximum points as they seek to keep their title hopes on track.It will not be a walk in the park for Chiefs as Casmyn, coached by former national team defender Dazzy Kapenya, seek to become the first club to beat the title favourites.Casmyn are third on the table with 15 points, 13 behind Chiefs. We re in the league to compete effectively and we re going to give it our best shot. I think what gives us an edge going into this game is that we re not under any sort of pressure and it s Chiefs feeling the heat, as they want to maintain their run.As for us, we re just building a squad that will challenge for the championship next season and what is important is to play our normal game and try to get a positive result, said Casmyn official Erick Chipangura.Casmyn go into Sunday s game from a 1-1 draw against ZRP Bulawayo, while Chiefs are bubbling with confidence following a hard fought 1-0 win over Talen Vision.Casmyn captain Charles Mususha, who scored against ZRP Bulawayo, wingback Webster Kondowe and former Highlanders and Lancashire Steel winger Wellington Grippa Sibanda are expected to lead the gold miners search for maximum points against Chiefs.Casmyn also have ex-Black Boots holding midfielder Golden Kamanga, striker Brian Muza and attacking midfielder Wellington Sinyolo, who have been impressive in the opening stages of the season.FixturesTomorrow: ZPC Hwange v Makomo (Hwange), Victoria Falls Tigers v Chiwororo (Victoria Falls), Bosso 90 v Black Boots (Luveve), Zim Leopards v Talen Vision (White City), Indlovu Iyanyathela v Amagagasi (HQ One Brigade)Sunday: Bulawayo Chiefs v Casmyn (Hartsfield, 12PM)Table ZililoR
