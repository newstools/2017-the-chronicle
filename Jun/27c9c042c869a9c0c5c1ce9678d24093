Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU have rejected the Premier Soccer League (PSL) s decision to charge them for causing the abandonment of their Castle Lager Premiership encounter against Dynamos at Ascot Stadium last weekend. Chapungu chief executive officer Air Commodore Innocent Chiganze said the incident was beyond the club s control and they would be consulting lawyers for advice on the way forward. We will consult our lawyers on the way forward because we feel that the incident was beyond our control. We lease Ascot Stadium from (Gweru City) Council and issues to do with goal posts lies with the local authority, said Chiganze. In any case, the stadium was given the green light to host Premiership matches, including on the day after inspection by the match officials. I hope football will be the winner at the end of the day when the case is heard. Chapungu were charged for breaching the Premier Soccer League Rules and Regulations and will appear before the PSL Disciplinary Committee on Thursday for causing the abandonment of a match due to failure to provide a replacement/reserve goal . In terms of Order 31 of the PSL Rules and Regulations, It is an Act of Misconduct on the part of the club where; 31.1.17: Its officials cause the abandonment of a match, read part of the press statement by PSL preferring charges against the airmen.The match was abandoned in the 56th minute after the goal post fell, while Dynamos were leading 4-0.This was after Dynamos Tichaona Chipunza s speculative drive took an awkward bounce and when Chapungu goalkeeper Talbert Shumba retreated to deal with the ball, he landed on the goal post and it collapsed.Efforts to fix the goal post were in vain and after a one hour 35 minute stoppage, match commissioner Israel Mugwagwa in consultation with referee Martin Chivandire called off the match.
