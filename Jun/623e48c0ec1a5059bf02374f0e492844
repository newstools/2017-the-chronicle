Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Plumtree Correspondent EIGHT pupils learning at Masendu Primary School in Bulilima District were treated and discharged after they were bitten by a stray rabid dog while at school. Bulilima District Administrator, Mrs Ethel Moyo said officers from the Veterinary Department and members of the Civil Protection Committee have been deployed to track down the rabid dog.Chief Masendu s secretary, Mr Freeman Dube said the dog attacked the pupils on Monday morning just as they were about to start their lessons. There are eight pupils learning at Masendu Primary School who were bitten by a rabid dog. They had dismissed from assembly and were heading for their classes when the dog went on a rampage and bit eight pupils. Teachers were alerted by screams from pupils who were running away and they managed to chase the dog out of the school. It appears that the dog just strayed into the school premises and that s when it attacked pupils, he said.Mr Dube said the affected pupils whose grades could not be immediately established were rushed to Masendu Clinic where they were treated and discharged.He said villagers from the area also teamed up in search of the stray rabid dog. So far we have not received any reports on the whereabouts of the dog but we hope that it will be tracked down and shot as it will endanger people s lives. We still haven t ascertained who the owner of the dog is. It s really fortunate that the damage on the lives of the pupils was minimal as it could have been worse, he said.Masendu Ward councillor, Mr Vincent Dube said the Veterinary Department had scheduled a vaccination programme set for today in order to curb the spread of rabies. Following the incident, the Veterinary Department has organised a vaccination programme set for tomorrow. The vaccination will be held at Masendu Business Centre and at the dip tank.@DubeMatutu
