Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter SECURITY organisations in Africa have been urged to take a leading role in the fight against HIV and Aids as well as other pandemics through behaviour change. This will help the continent in achieving its agenda to end HIV and Aids by 2030 as well as meet Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs).Officially closing the 6th Zimbabwe Uniformed Forces Health Services conference in Victoria Falls yesterday, Zimbabwe Republic Police Deputy Commissioner General Levi Sibanda said security forces were at more risk of pandemics because of the nature of their jobs hence a change in behaviour will not only save them but society at large as well. The discussions here have given you a higher level of consciousness which should make it possible to positively influence your work environment and mould behaviour of colleagues and society at large. Prevention education should remain an important tool for reduction of the scourge of all forms of diseases among security personnel hence we need to take responsibility for our own personal health, he said.Dep Comm Gen Sibanda said combining efforts on health matters will also buttress peace and security on the continent. A healthy security force guarantees peace in any country. With the crystallisation of our best medical minds, we should be able to tie up the scourge of pandemics in our midst. This conference ably reminded us of the ambitious national efforts to end the Aids pandemic by 2030. Knowledge is our guide, our sword, our gun and without it we are blind. As we go back to our work stations, we are challenged to use the knowledge imparted to us to self-introspect and where necessary assist our fellow workmen and women to quickly change their attitudes or living styles and perceptions, Dep Comm Gen Sibanda said.The three-day conference that was held under the theme: HIV and the risk of non-communicable diseases in the uniformed forces: Initiating sustainable dialogue started on Wednesday and ended yesterday.It brought together health experts, policy makers and security forces from across the African continent to exchange ideas and create an environment conducive for scientific dialogue in the security sector in Africa.@ncubeleon
