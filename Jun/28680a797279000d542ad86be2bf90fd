Mdu MhlongoTHANDA Royal Zulu have been served with legal documents which aim to prohibit the sale of the club. Following a decision by Thanda chairman Pierre Delvaux that he would be open to selling the club citing financial constraints as his reason for that decision, AmaZulu came knocking with the intention of buying Amabhubesi s PSL status.The proposed sale has been met with displeasure from the City of uMhlathuze where Thanda are currently based. The city is opposing the idea of selling the club, saying the people of Richard s Bay and soccer lovers from the area have been supportive of the team throughout the many years that the club has campaigned in the National First Division (NFD). We have been working hard to see Thanda climbing to the top leagues and fully supporting the club with our facilities and financially investing (in) the team knowing that when they play at the top level, our investment will be paid back and our people, especially soccer lovers and youth, will benefit. Little did we know that we are assisting people who have no interest in investing in the city and in the club anymore, Mayor Mdu Mhlongo said in a statement.Mhlongo further appealed to PSL chairman Irvin Khoza and the PSL to dismiss the transaction between Thanda and AmaZulu.The PSL executive committee met yesterday to discuss the proposed sale of Thanda s PSL franchise to AmaZulu, who are currently in the NFD.Thanda are expected to make around R60 million from the sale of their newly acquired PSL status.However, it has been confirmed by sources close to the KwaZulu-Natal outfit that Thanda have now been served with legal documents to try and block the sale of the club.AmaZulu are coached by Joey Antipas, who would find himself rubbing shoulders with some of the continent s top coaches in the PSL if the sale goes through.- Soccer Laduma&nbsp;
