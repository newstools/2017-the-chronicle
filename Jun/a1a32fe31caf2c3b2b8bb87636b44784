An outdoor cinemaLeonard Ncube in Victoria Falls OUTDOOR movie lovers in Victoria Falls are in for a treat after a local entertainment company introduced the big screen on Friday. Night life in Victoria Falls has in the past been subdued because of lack of activities and facilities, but now people have a choice as the outdoor cinema has come to stay.There are a few night clubs that have tried to cover the gap, despite high demand for night life especially by tourists who end up frequenting bars to compensate for missing activities.The outdoor show premiered with the movie Beauty and the Beast at Victoria Falls Primary School on Friday, with scores of people comprising children and adults braving the cold weather to take time out.People quietly followed the movie sitting on the ground as well as on hay pellets at the school s grounds.The brains behind the big screen Kudakwashe Mataga of Nitrus Club said this is the start of outdoor cinema in Victoria Falls. This is the first of its kind in Victoria Falls. When we entered the entertainment business we looked at what could be lacking and found that night life isn t catered for. We opened our bar and now we expanding to the big screen, said Mataga.He said the screen will be movable and venues will rotate according to the nature of content being shown on a particular night.It will be showing in high density suburbs, town and as well as leisure centres on the outskirts of town.The night outs will be on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays while on Fridays it will be showing in Hwange. We won t be stationary but will go places. Today was just a launch hence it was free of charge and going forward we will be charging according to the theme and venue. Today was a family night which is why there were children but we will be having cosy nights, or romantic nights which won t be ideal for children and that s when we will move the venue to places not reachable for children, he said.@ncubeleon
