Showbiz Reporter A NEW beauty boutique SuQea Fashion Hub is set to cater for the needs of the modern woman s desire to be more beautiful using the latest make up products. The fashion hub located in the city centre, opened its doors in March and will today hold a make-up workshop at the Bulawayo Club. The workshop is expected to start at 2PM.To be part of the workshop that will feature brow tutorials, ways to apply make up, contouring and highlighting as well as give people winter tips, one will have to part with $30. Each participant will receive a six-piece concealer palette, lippy and an eye brow kit, said the founder of SuQea Fashion Hub, Sukoluhle Bhebhe who will be spearheading the workshop.She said she wanted to help women enhance their beauty. I realised some women were not making an effort to complete their outlook by taking care of their facials well. The idea is to change the stereotypical look of the local girl, such that she can stand head to toe with the most good looking lass in the world arena. SuQea is about bringing glamour to the local girl, said Bhebhe. A woman s demeanour needs to be flowered with decorum coupled with looking good which then boosts self-esteem and confidence. The girl needs to feel that she is exuding the right character as she goes around her daily business. &nbsp;
