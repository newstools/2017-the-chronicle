Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter FORTWELL Wholesale has invested about $3 million in the last two years to grow its business and expand its footprint. Managing director Mr George Androuliakos said the investment has helped the company maintain a good brand and consolidate its business. This kind of investment has helped us to grow the Fortwell brand. We used the funding to grow the brand in order to have a good market value, he said.Fortwell, which has three branches in Bulawayo and one in Victoria Falls, has been operational since 1985 and employs about 250 workers.Speaking on the sidelines of the company s customer appreciation cocktail party in Bulawayo on Wednesday, Mr Androuliakos also lauded Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016, which restricts importation of several goods. At the beginning, it (S.I.64) was tough but now I m seeing the fruits. It has taken a year and a half but now customers are having faith in local products and this has enabled us to be viable in business. Buying of local products by customers is very important because it creates employment in the economy. When one buys a local product he or she will be employing someone but when one buys an imported product he or she will be boosting the outside market and this does not create employment locally and it is not good for the economy, said Mr Androuliakos.@kiyaz_Cool.
