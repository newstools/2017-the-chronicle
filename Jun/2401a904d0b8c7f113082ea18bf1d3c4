Guide GoddardSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGH riding Chicken Inn will be seeking a fourth straight win when they take on faltering ZPC Kariba in a Castle Lager Premiership match at Luveve Stadium this afternoon. Maximum points could propel the Bulawayo side into second place on the league table.Chicken Inn, who started their campaign on a blistering note with a 5-0 demolition of Bantu Rovers before hobbling and failing to register a win in Bulawayo in four consecutive matches, are presently on a three-match winning streak.Rahman Gumbo s men have won their previous six matches by just a single goal and Gumbo says there is a need for improvement.Chicken Inn beat Highlanders, Shabanie Mine, Harare City, Yadah Stars, Hwange and Triangle United by identical 1-0 score lines. We definitely need to improve on our scoring rate, but we are happy with the progress we have made, said Gumbo.However, Gumbo must be satisfied with his defence marshalled by the revitalised Guide Goddard, although he missed the team s last away trip to Harare City. His partnership with Moses Jackson has been unyielding in central defence. Guide is back and is available for selection, so is Teenage Hadebe who returns from national duty, said Gumbo.A win for Chicken Inn will take their points tally to 24 points and depending on the outcome of the Black Rhinos and Highlanders match, the Bulawayo side might end the day second to Ngezi Platinum Stars, who take on Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow evening.ZPC Kariba come to Bulawayo on the backdrop of a 3-1 home win over struggling Bantu Rovers, their only win in four outings, having lost to Dynamos and Ngezi before drawing with Chapungu.They, however, have a shrewd mentor in Sunday Chidzambwa, who is capable of engineering a result for his troops anywhere in the country.In other matches set for today, Bulawayo City are on the road to Chapungu, hoping to put aside their derby loss to How Mine by bouncing back into winning ways, while Triangle United will be home to Shabanie Mine at Gibbo Stadium.FC Platinum are home to Harare City and can extend their unbeaten run to 12 games. FC Platinum will be without skipper Simon Shoko, who is suspended after accumulating three yellow cards.FixturesToday: Chapungu v Bulawayo City (Ascot), Chicken Inn v ZPC Kariba (Luveve), FC Platinum v Harare City (Mandava), Black Rhinos v Highlanders (Morris Depot), Triangle United v Shabanie Mine (Gibbo)Thursday: Bantu Rovers v Tsholotsho FC (Luveve), How Mine v Yadah FC (Luveve), Dynamos v Ngezi Platinum (National Sports Stadium, 7PM), Hwange v Caps United (postponed).@skhumoyo2000
