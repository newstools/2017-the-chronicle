Deputy Minister Fred MoyoWynne Zanamwe, Midlands Reporter The Deputy Minister of Mines and Mining Development Engineer Fred Moyo has warned villagers in Mazvihwa communal lands in Zvishavane against abusing donations such as seed and fertiliser meant to boost agricultural production. Speaking at the handover of education and infrastructural development projects funded by Murowa Daimonds Mine to the tune of $450 000 at Baradzanwa Primary School in Zvishavane recently, Deputy Minister Moyo said instead of putting to good use such donations, some villagers were stealing the inputs and selling them on the black market.Eng Moyo who is also the legislator for Zvishavane-Runde constituency said the community should not abuse the infrastructure funded by the mine meant to improve their lives. Murowa Diamonds has been assisting the community with seed and fertilisers, funded construction of classroom blocks and has helped establish and capacitate 12 small to medium enterprises while offering contracts to local youths, said Eng Moyo.Handing over Jimu Bridge, Baradzanwa school infrastructure, which includes a borehole, water reticulation and electrification of classrooms and teachers cottages funded by the mine, board chairman of RioZim and Murowa, Mr Lovemore Chihota said the projects were meant to improve the lives of the people of Mazvihwa as well as provide a conducive learning environment for pupils of Baradzanwa primary school.Mr Chihota said the mine was committed to uplifting the communities from which it operates hence it was funding development projects. We decided to intervene and construct a bridge following many accidents at the old Jimu bridge. It is our hope that the new bridge will help reduce accidents, he said.Mr Chihota said Murowa Diamonds decided to plough back to the community as part of its corporate social responsibility. Today we also mark yet another milestone that will put Baradzanwa School on the map of Zvishavane District and becomes a fully equipped primary school just like those in urban areas, he said.Mr Chihota said the mine was planning to buy computers for the school now that it has electricity.@wynnezane
