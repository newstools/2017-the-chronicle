Charity Ruzvidzo, Health Matters THE National Blood Services of Zimbabwe (NBSZ) says it is able to meet the country s demand for blood throughout the year despite the high cost that has made the life-saving liquid inaccessible to many. The NBSZ has always been making calls to members of the public to donate as much blood as they can, a move which has seen the availability of blood and blood products increasing tremendously.However, at more than $100 per pint, most people in need of transfusion cannot afford the products.Speaking on the sidelines of the World Blood Donor Day commemorations held on Wednesday at their offices in the capital, NBSZ spokesperson Ms Esther Massundah said while her organisation can meet demand for blood, it needs funding to be able to supply the blood at affordable prices. Blood donations have been increasing over the years. This year, we are targeting on collecting 70 000 units of blood and we are basing this on the demand patterns, she said.World Blood Donor Day is observed annually on June 14 to thank voluntary donors for their gift of blood and to teach members of the public the importance of saving life through blood donations.This year s theme was Blood donation in emergencies .All NBSZ branches in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Mutare opened their doors to blood drives, tours of the NBSZ facilities and open day exhibitions.According to Ms Massundah, 70 percent of the donations come from youths. The youths contribute immensely with blood donations. They constitute 70 percent of our donators. We also have an active donor base of over 40 000 people who are also consistent, said Ms Massundah.She said the blood bank still requires funding to boost its resources. The issue of blood cost is always a thorn in the flesh to government and us. We would like to give blood for free but unfortunately there are costs associated with testing and ensuring the blood is clean before transfusions. We urge those who can to assist with funding, said Ms Massundah.According to the World Health Organisation, blood donation by one percent of the population can meet a nation s most basic requirements for blood.The United Nations agency says blood is an important resource, both for planned treatments and urgent interventions.It can help patients suffering from life-threatening conditions live longer and supports complex medical and surgical procedures.WHO further states that in 2014, 67 percent of blood was used to treat conditions including anaemia, cancer and blood disorders, 27 percent was used in surgery, and six percent was used to treat blood loss after childbirth.While blood transfusion saves life and improves health, some Zimbabweans are still skeptical about blood donations. There are myths surrounding blood donations because some religions do not believe in blood donations. However, blood has no substitute; it only comes from the human body. As NBSZ, we are educating people in a bid to demystify the negative views associated with donating blood, said Ms Massundah.Ms Martha Lunga (22), who donated blood for the first time at the commemorations, said her mother s illness inspired her to donate blood. My mother fell very ill last year and we were required to buy blood for her to survive. This prompted me to come and donate blood today and also save a life just as my mother s life was saved, she said.Ms Lunga said donating blood on a voluntary basis was a sign of heroism. Some countries give monetary incentives to blood donors. This is not the case in Zimbabwe yet you find a large number of people donating blood freely, this is indeed a sign of heroism, she said.In Zimbabwe, the demand for blood transfusion normally rises during public holidays due to increased road accidents as most people travel more during this period.According to the NBSZ, for any successful blood donation programme to take place in the country, the government plays an important role in creating a conducive environment through effective policies that support the World Health Assembly resolution, which urges all WHO member states to promote and support the establishment of sustainable blood fusion based on voluntary non-remunerated blood donation.Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Health and Child Care has been working together with the NBSZ to support the blood donation programmes.The objectives of this year s World Blood Donor day were to encourage all people to strengthen the emergency preparedness of health services in their community by donating blood.It also sought to engage authorities in the establishment of an effective national blood programme with the capacity to respond promptly to the increase in blood demand.It was also aimed at promoting the inclusion of blood transfusion in national emergency preparedness and to build wider public awareness of the need for committed, year round blood donation, in order to maintain adequate supplies and achieve national self-sufficiency of blood.In many countries, there is not an adequate supply of safe blood, and blood services face the challenge of making sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and safety.Zimbabwe is part of a group of countries that have achieved WHO s goal for all countries to obtain all their blood supplies from voluntary unpaid donors by 2020.At least 60 countries in 2014 had their national blood supplies based on almost close to 100 percent voluntary unpaid blood donations.Access to safe and sufficient blood and blood products can help reduce rates of death and disability due to severe bleeding during delivery and after childbirth.Statistics show that at least one patient in seven entering a hospital will need blood.Thus, it should be a collective effort to ensure blood availability Zimpapers Syndication
