The BAAs will be held at the Large City Hall on Friday with the who s who of the local arts and showbiz scene expected to congregate at the venue.The house band will see drummer Erastus Nleya, bassist David Mabhena, keyboardists Sam Mabhena and Oktopus, guitarist Hudson Simbarashe, saxophone player Mbaki Nleya and percussionists Othnell Mangoma and Bruno Ashley pool their talents together to give the audience a unique musical experience on what is expected to be a glamorous night.Other performers are yet to be revealed.Despite the widespread enthusiasm and publicity leading up to the awards extravaganza, many were still in the dark about what their favourite personalities would actually walk away with should they come out tops on the night.The gongs themselves are pleasing to the eye and are likely to occupy prime space on the night s victors display cabinets.Gold and silver stars balanced on a black base are their most prominent feature, with a silver plaque displaying the name of the category on offer. The black base symbolises Bulawayo as a base where our stars are birthed and or launched. A black base also represents abantu as the majority of artistes were born or are practising in Bulawayo, read a post that announced the gongs on BAA s official Facebook page.The stars balancing on each other, the post said, are meant to signify that only with unity could Bulawayo s stars shine to the best of their abilities. The gold and silver stars speak for themselves. The awards are about recognising our own stars and pushing them out into the world. The two stars at the top symbolise that only if our stars or artistes stick together then they will shine more and go further than Bulawayo. The plaque is silver, shines from afar and for a long time. A quality we believe Bulawayo artistes possess.
