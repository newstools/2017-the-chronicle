Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Aquatic Union (ZAU) has selected four athletes to represent the country in the 17th edition of the FINA World Championships set for Budapest, Hungary, from July 14-30. The four are Peter Welzlar, James Lawson, Robyn Lee and Devyn Leask, who will be accompanied by ZAU president Mary Kloppers and coach Sheelah Crause to the east European nation.Kloppers said the swimmers were selected based on the FINA points system. FINA set a qualifying criterion and thereafter we used FINA points to determine which athletes could attend. Zimbabwe was allocated a total of four athletes. FINA also specified that for unqualified athletes we had to include two female athletes for gender equality purposes, Kloppers said.She said preparations were underway with all four athletes in full training.With seven-time Olympic medalist Kirsty Coventry having done well at similar competitions, Kloppers said they were hoping to see male swimmers winning medals at international galas. This is the first time we have had a male qualify for the World Champs. We are happy about this development as it clearly shows Zimbabwe swimming still has something to offer after Kirsty. It is now imperative that the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) and the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) support these swimmers, as qualifying for World Champs is a very good indication of future Olympic qualification, she said.Kloppers will be the first to depart for Budapest where she will attend two congresses from July 21-22.@khumzallen
