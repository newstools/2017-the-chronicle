Showbiz Reporter A NEW entertainment and leisure joint, Green Corner Executive Bar, has opened in the farming environs of Rangemore outside Bulawayo, bringing a promise to up the live music hype in the usually quiet part of the city. Owned by an entrepreneurial minded group of indigenous business women called Upfumi Kumadzimai/Inotho Kubomama, the club becomes the first ever to be managed by a consortium of female businesswomen whose aim is to empower young entertainers in the city.Nestled in the once busy showbiz hub at Rangemore business complex, Green Corner Leisure Resorts has in two months of opening, attracted an array of pleasure seekers and boasts of having the biggest stage to accommodate live music performances.For years Rangemore a farming community on the outskirts of Bulawayo, has been starved of a real place of entertainment and the club s management said they want to turn the area into a hive of entertainment activity.Mrs Nonceba Mwedzi-Agwaniru, the Upfumi Kumadzimai/Inotho Kubomama programmes coordinator, said the bar seeks to be the foremost platform for every musician, in particular women only bands. As women at Upfumi Kumadzimani/Inotho Kubomama, we re a business oriented group that seeks to empower young artistes in Bulawayo. The reason we opened Green Corner Executive Bar is to give local musicians, especially those fronted by women, a chance to be seen and heard. Moreover, the place is to make sure that in Bulawayo, there s a place that accommodates revellers that want a peace of mind while enjoying the serene atmosphere of Rangemore, said Mwedzi-Agwaniru.She said in the near future, they would broaden their entertainment scope and open a Tshisa Nyama spot next to the bar. From the feedback we re getting, we plan to expand and offer more services. When we opened in April, we almost failed to handle the large crowds that swamped the new club. Having brought a new entertainment dimension to a quiet place like Rangemore, we were sure to get support from the local community and revellers coming from other parts of the city. This is the place for the urban mature and the well-to-do class that enjoys quality entertainment away from the busy city life.
