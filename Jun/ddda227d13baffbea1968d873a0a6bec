I appreciate Boom Beto s inimitable talent and his originality in his genre which made me to work with him, he said.The single was mastered and recorded at Mount Zion Records in Harare.BhadilahShaker comes hard on the heels of yet another single, Dzungudza that is making waves on local radio stations and was once a chart-topper on Power FM.The 20-year old house artiste began his musical career at Jason Ziyaphapha Moyo High School in 2015 and he never looked back.
