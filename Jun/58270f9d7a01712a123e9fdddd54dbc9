Knowledge MusonaEddie Chikamh, Harare Bureau NEW Warriors skipper, Knowledge Musona, is aiming for a perfect take-off as the captain when they host Liberia in the opening match of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations against Liberia at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow.Musona, who was handed the responsibility during the week, yesterday said he was eagerly waiting for his chance to fill in the big shoes that were once worn by great Zimbabwean players like Peter Ndlovu, Ephraim Chawanda, Tinashe Nengomasha and Benjani Mwaruwari.Naturally, the responsibility comes with added pressure.Musona is pumped up following success with his European club K.V Oostende who recently booked their place to play in the Eorpa League next year. There is no pressure at all. I ll just play football the same way I was doing before. You know, it s very easy to play football if you play simple. So we are going to play as a team. If we work hard and give 100 percent I m sure we will be able to get a positive result, said Musona. Zimbabwe, who were part of the elite nations at the last Afcon finals in Gabon, are looking forward to another fruitful campaign in search of another ticket to the big stage in Cameroon in two years time.They are in Group G that also includes giants Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo-Brazzaville.The Congolese neighbours will clash in the first group match in Kinshasa today.And, with the qualifiers set to resume next year, Musona believes Zimbabwe have to start on a good footing as they have two consecutive away matches against the Congolese teams in March and September of 2018.His immediate focus, though, is on winning the first match tomorrow. I think everything is good so far and we are looking forward to Sunday. Definitely (we will be going for goals) because if you want to win three points at the end of the 90 minutes you need to score goals and defend also, said Musona.
