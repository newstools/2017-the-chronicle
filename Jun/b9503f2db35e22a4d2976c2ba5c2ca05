The construction site where the complex will be builtOliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE construction of a $12 million shopping complex in Bulawayo s high density suburb of Cowdray Park is underway with the contractor already on site carrying out geo-technical surveys. Prominent Bulawayo businessman and Sai Enterprises proprietor, Mr Raj Modi, is building the shopping mall whose groundbreaking ceremony was officiated by Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa in April. The contractor started work on the 1st of June and has so far erected a fence and is clearing the site. We are hoping that we will be able to finish construction under the first phase as scheduled, said Mr Modi.Construction of the proposed mall under the first phase is set for completion by the end of the year.The multi-million dollar complex, which will have over 40 shops, is also expected to house banks, medical service centre, fast foods and parking bays. We are now waiting for the Tzircalle Brothers (the project s contractor) to start excavating and building of the complex s foundation once they are done with the site settings, Mr Modi said.When this paper visited the construction site yesterday, it observed that the project s contractor was on the ground, working on some geo-technical surveys. It is our hope that, should they not be disturbed by the rains in the next rainy season, the project s first phase will be completed within the time frame, said Mr Modi, who also owns a beverages outlet, The Wholesale Centre Liquor Hub. The second phase of the proposed shopping complex is expected to be completed by June next year, said the Bulawayo business tycoon.Mr Modi said Sai Enterprises was also developing a one kilometre road from the main road in Cowdray Park to the shopping complex.The road project is being done through a Public-Private Partnership with the Bulawayo City Council. In the 1990s, Mr Modi built Bellevue shopping complex which now houses one of the leading and fastest growing supermarkets run by Choppies Enterprises.@okazunga
