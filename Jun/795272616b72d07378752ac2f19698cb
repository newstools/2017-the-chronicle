Councillor Knowledge NdlovuRichard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE commission appointed by Government to conduct a fact finding mission on Gwanda municipality s capacity to run its water system has concluded its work. The commission is set to hand-over a report of its findings to the Minister of Environment, Water and Climate, Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri.The Minister appointed a seven-member commission headed by the Ministry s deputy director of water management, Engineer Gilbert Mawere two weeks ago following a dispute between Zinwa and the local authourity over management of water supplies for the town.Zinwa also said the municipality owed it $10 million for water while council said it owes the water authority less than $3 million.Gwanda Mayor Councillor Knowledge Ndlovu yesterday confirmed that the commission had concluded its work. Yes, they finished their fact finding mission on Saturday. They told us that after departing this town they will hand over the report to their principal who is Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri who set up the commission. We are very hopeful that things will go our way and we will be formally handed over the water treatment plant so that we run it on behalf of the residents of Gwanda, said Clr Ndlovu.Zinwa and the town fathers were embroiled in a fight over water with the municipality saying it must run the town s water treatment plant.The impasse led to Zinwa resorting to water cuts leading Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri to intervene two months ago.The Minister directed Zinwa to resort to water rationing rather than water cuts.Government has since agreed to give the municipality the right to run the water treatment plant leading to the setting up of the commission.The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Engineer George Mlilo, has previously thrown his weight behind the municipality s takeover of the water treatment plant.@richardmuponde
