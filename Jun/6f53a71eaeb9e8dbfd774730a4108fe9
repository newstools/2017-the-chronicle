After opening their 2017 campaign in blistering form in which they annihilated city neighbours Bantu Rover 5-0, Rahman Gumbo s boys went on a yoyo performance, losing at home and winning on the road until they found their mark against another city side Highlanders. They have never looked back since that victory over Bosso.Gumbo s boys have chalked up five consecutive wins in the process, managing to keep a clean sheet in all the victories and storming into the leadership pack, although they find themselves third on the table by virtue of an inferior goal difference to Black Rhinos and Ngezi.Tonderayi Ndiraya s Ngezi have hit the net an incredible 23 times this season, the last 11 coming in their last five games against Tsholotsho (4-1 win), Bulawayo City (3-2 win ), Dynamos (3-2 loss) and Bantu Rovers (2-2).However, Ngezi have conceded seven goals in the five matches, a loophole Chicken Inn might exploit to their full advantage.While Chicken Inn have managed just six goals in five matches, 1-0 wins over Highlanders, Shabanie Mine, Harare City and Tsholotsho as well as a 2-0 win over ZPC Kariba, goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze has gone for 450 minutes without conceding.The keeper should be in the running for the Castle Lager Player of the Month alongside teammates Guide Goddard and Moses Jackson as well as Highlanders Tendai Ndlovu.Tomorrow s game will present a true test of their championship credentials, more so since Ngezi are fully aware that a further drop of points will not do them any favour, having failed to win in their last three outings.Last season, the two sides played to a 0-0 stalemate before Ngezi prevailed 2-1 at Baobab Stadium in the reverse fixture.
