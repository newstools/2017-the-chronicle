Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls REGGAE music lovers in Victoria Falls had a rare treat on Saturday when a Bulawayo based reggae group performed at the New Victoria Falls Sports Bar. The group, called the Art of Reggae, is on a mission to establish itself in the resort town where there is a significant population of Rastafarians.The six-member group went on stage just after 8PM and performed until midnight.In an interview, leader of the group Lemington Muzhingi who also promoted the show, said he was happy with the attendance.He said the idea was to promote reggae music. We used to play reggae and we thought not much is being done for the genre in Victoria Falls. We used to play with the Zig Zag Band and at Jenaguru Music Festival. All this is history as people now just play cover songs. We don t think reggae should be like that. There should be a reggae group so that fans are not starved. The crowd is not big but we are grateful for the support we got from Rastafarians as you can see they are the majority here, said Muzhingi.The other group members are drummer Duncan Matongo, Victor Hulk Pullen and his younger brother Brain who play bass guitar and lead vocalist respectively as well as lead guitarist Chamunorwa Katsande and Ras Terra on keyboard.The manager at the New Victoria Falls Sports Bar Chrisper Maja said he was impressed by the group s performance. They had a good performance and all they need is to be marketed. We are grateful because they gave us an insight of how best we can hold shows and events here, he said.The sports bar was opened on May 25 .Meanwhile, the Ngamnanka Usamamoe hitmaker Madlela Sikhobokhobo s show was moved to next Saturday as he ended up performing in Gwanda where he shared the stage with Clement Magwaza on Saturday.@ncubeleon
