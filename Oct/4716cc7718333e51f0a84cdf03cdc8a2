 Locadia Mavhudzi, Business Reporter ZIMBABWE’S pig industry is poised for growth following last season’s bumper harvest which ensures adequate feed supply, an official said. Pig Industry Board (PIB) director, Mr Andrew Shonhiwa, said the pig industry was coming from the doldrums with positive prospects as key raw materials for production of feeds were now available. “Our industry is now growing considering that the key raw materials for production of feeds are now available. We would like to applaud Government for the Command Agriculture programme because the availability of maize and soya beans increases production levels in the pig industry,” he said. Mr Shonhiwa said pig farmers were also impressed with the constant price of feed. He said demand for pork has also increased following the recent shortages of poultry and poultry products. “We have also experienced a seasonal demand for pork after chicken and egg production levels went down due to the recent Avian flu that saw countries in Southern Africa experiencing a decline in poultry production,” he said. Mr Shonhiwa, however, said pig farmers were threatened by the alternating extreme temperatures and the health challenges that pigs were exposed to. “The change in climatic conditions is a major threat to us in piggery because pigs are sensitive to heat. Heat stress can result in reduced productivity including fertility problems,” he said.The pig industry has been going through a difficult patch due to a combination of factors that include high costs of stock feed, a ban on exports of fresh pork, depressed demand due to low consumer spending and low producer prices.
