 Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter POLICE have arrested four Hwange villagers after they allegedly distributed maize seed under the Presidential Input Scheme to members of the community without authority. Phumulani Ndlovu (38), Lovemore Ndlovu (50), Phephisiwe Dube (41) and Dumisani Khumalo (44) from Kachechete Ward 3 in Hwange were arrested on Thursday in Ndlovu. The officer commanding Victoria Falls district Chief Superintendent Jairos Chiwona confirmed the arrest and said the suspects were likely to be charged with robbery. “I can confirm that we picked four suspects for robbery and we are holding them in custody as they are assisting with investigations. This is after they allegedly took maize seed under the Presidential Input Scheme. “We want to urge members of the public not to take the law into their own hands as they may end up being arrested for committing an offence,” said Chief Supt Chiwona. Mpumelelo B village head Mr Gilbert Ncube said all 18 families in his village were sidelined after being told that their names could not be found on the list of beneficiaries. Procedurally, officials from the GMB should compile a final list of beneficiaries in liaison with the local leadership. However, on Tuesday, a local politician (name supplied) allegedly “hijacked” the process and compiled her own list of beneficiaries which had names of non-existent people. There was chaos during the illegal distribution of the maize seed on Tuesday. The Presidential Inputs are meant for every citizen regardless of political affiliation and government has warned against abuse of the inputs. — @ncubeleon.
