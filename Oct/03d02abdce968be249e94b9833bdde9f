Showbiz Correspondent THOSE proud of their natural African hair are in for a treat this weekend as they will gather at a Natural Hair and Beauty Expo taking place at the Hillside Dams tomorrow. The serene natural environment at Hillside Dams will serve as the perfect setting for people to be shown how to take care of natural hair using organic beauty products. The event is expected to start at 1PM, ending at 6PM with entrance pegged at $5. A variety of speakers have been lined up for the event, including former Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Samantha Tshuma, activist Soneni Gwizi, natural hair expert Pearl Fraser-Granger, Afro centric designer Tashinga Mpofu and beautician Sharon Chingwaru. A range of ethnic food stalls will also be available, as well as stalls for businesses that sell related products. Natural hair brand ambassadors – hip hop musician Asaph, award-winning model Shadel, Chipo Mpofu, Nina Williams and Nontokozo Tshuma will also be on standby to assist people with questions they may have on hair products. To top it all off, live music will be provided by afro jazz sensation De Lukes and Mimmie Tarukwana. Poet Kapitol’s act will be infused with musical instruments. One of the organisers of the event Ntando Ndlovu said they wanted to unite people who love natural beauty. “This’ll be a premier annual event that’ll seek to bring people with a love for natural beauty together. Our goal is to create an experience and environment that celebrates natural beauty and raise significant awareness of the many nature-based beauty and hair products available on the local market,” said Ndlovu. He said after the experience, people should spread the word to others. “Ultimately, we hope to provide our audience with an experience that’ll grow an appreciation for natural beauty and lifestyle products, all this in an environment that’s fun filled and fosters cultural synergy.”
