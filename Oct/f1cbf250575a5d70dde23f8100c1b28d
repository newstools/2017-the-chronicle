 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A 22-YEAR-OLD man from Njube suburb in Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly stealing two cellphones and a camp light from his cousin. Alex Magagula appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube facing three counts of theft. He was remanded in custody for plea recording. Prosecuting, Ms Magret Takawira said the accused took a cellphone from his cousin, Sindiso Magagula’s house in Njube on September 23 this year and he never returned it when asked to do so. “Again on October 15, Magagula took another cellphone from the same address which also belonged to the complainant. He was later asked to bring both cellphones back and he kept on promising but he never delivered on his promise,” she said. The State alleged that on Monday the complainant discovered that her camp light was missing soon after the accused had left her place of residence. She suspected that Magagula had stolen it and reported the matter at ZRP Njube leading to the arrest of the accused person. The value of the stolen items was estimated at $160 and nothing was recovered. — @SlyCee.
