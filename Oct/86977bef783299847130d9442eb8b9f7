Mr Phillipe Van Damme Kiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter THE four-day European Union (EU) Film Festival kicked off at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo yesterday with the screening of an acclaimed assortment of films from across Europe. Ambassador Philippe Van Damme, head of the EU delegation in Zimbabwe, said he was happy to bring the festival which was successfully held in Harare five months ago to Bulawayo, with the hope that the European movies will entertain the audience. “We’re very excited to finally bring the festival to Bulawayo and some outstanding European movies that’ll entertain and touch the audience. “Cinema, however, is not just about entertainment. It’s about the expression of identities, reflecting the state of a society and community. Our films are inspired by the core principles of Europe: unity in diversity; cultural, linguistic or even ethnic diversity; and unity of values, such as equality and democracy, as well as our social model,” said Van Damme. Admission to all screenings is free. This year’s selection of cinema presents film enthusiasts with vivid pictures of Europe’s societies in their all-encompassing facets and cultures, a wide scope of stories that engage and pay tribute to the common traits of human nature. British Council office manager Melody Sango urged the Bulawayo community to come in their numbers as the film festival is open to everyone. @Kiyaz_Cool
