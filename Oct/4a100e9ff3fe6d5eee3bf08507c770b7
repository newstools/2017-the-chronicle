Tawanda Musarurwa, Harare Bureau PLATINUM output at the Anglo American Platinum-owned Unki Mine near Shurugwi town in the Midlands Province rose nine percent to 19 000 ounces for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. Management attributed the rise in output at Unki to successful implementation of strategies to reduce waste at the mine. The quarter under review’s output of 19 000 was an improvement on the 18 200 ounces delivered during the comparable period last year. “Unki production increased by nine percent to 19 000 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control have reduced waste, leading to increased grade and higher production,” said Anglo American Platinum on Tuesday. The group has invested around $350 million in the Zimbabwean operation since it started operations, producing 67 000 refined platinum ounces in 2013 and production has been on a steady rise since 2011. Unki is the third largest platinum producer in the country after Zimbabwe Platinum Holdings (Zimplats) and Mimosa Mine. Anglo American Platinum said platinum production (metal in concentrate) was flat at 621 400 ounces. It also said production guidance for platinum has been lowered to 2,30 million – 2,35 million ounces following the closure of unprofitable production at Bokoni, which was placed on care and maintenance in the quarter. The group will process inventories of 100 000 ounces of platinum, meaning its refined platinum forecast for the year, while also projected to be 50 000 ounces lower than previously expected, would be in a range of 2, 4 million to 2, 45 million ounces.
