Sulumani Chimbetu Nonsikelelo Moyo, Victoria Falls Reporter DENDERA ace Sulumani “Sulu” Chimbetu makes the long trip to Victoria Falls this weekend to reignite his relationship with fans after having last performed at a public gig in the resort town four years ago. Of late, he has been playing at private events here, something that has left his fans yearning for his shows. He has heeded that call and will perform at the new Vic Falls Sports Club on Saturday night. His band manager, Carlton Mparutsa, said: “This will be Sulu’s first public show in Victoria Falls after four years as he’s been performing at corporate events. After realising it’d been a while since he last performed for the public, we decided to visit the resort town and spoil fans there who’ve supported Sulu’s career.” Sulu of the Sean Timba fame will be backed by his Orchestra Dendera Kings band. Meanwhile, traditional music lovers in the resort town should also expect a rare treat as Victor Chindedza, popularly known as Papa Vic Dada, will perform at the same venue tomorrow. With his Motsi Uruka band, the South Africa-based Papa Vic Dada said he would perform hits including Zula Zula, Ndabaiwa and Handei Kumombe among many other favourites. Supporting acts for the reggae night include Asher Banton, Ras Tera, Lemi Dread, Lady Banks, Ghetto Man, Top Notch DJ, 100% Kaliz and Selekta King Zeb. @nonsy_m
