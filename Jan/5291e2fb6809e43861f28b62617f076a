Professor Wiseman MagwaFrom Walter Mswazie in Masvingo IN light of the new curriculum introduced by the Government this year, Reformed Church University Vice Chancellor, Professor Wiseman Magwa has penned a book, Tsika Dzavatema MuZimbabwe: Bhuku Rekutanga. The book, one of many writings that the renowned academic and author has done since Zimbabwe attained its independence in 1980 is a must-read textbook for all learners in the wake of the new curriculum.The six-chapter book which can be used in high schools, colleges and universities for their heritage studies, and features other prolific writers such as, Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) Vice Chancellor Professor Rungano Zvobgo, lecturers; Professor Shumirai Nyarota, Dr Dickson Mazuruse, Mrs Tsitsi Nyoni, Mr Kutsirayi Gondo and Mr Benjamin Mudzanire. The thrust behind this book is to contribute to the success of the new curriculum while taking care of our constitutional requirements. Our constitution recognises 16 languages as official languages and Shona is one of them, hence writing my book in Shona. The new curriculum framework (2015-2022) focuses on the enhancement of quality education through demonstrating high degree of Ubuntu/Unhu, national identity and heritage studies, said Prof Magwa.He said plans are afoot to translate the book on other five languages so that more learners can understand its contents without any problem.The writers contend that no development in Zimbabwe can be achieved without consideration of local languages in educational, socio-economic and political processes.In the book an attempt to discuss the correlation between language, culture and society is made when Mr Gondo calls on the powers-that-be to promote culture and indigenous languages as provided for in the country s constitution.In Chapter two, Prof Magwa presents the nexus between development and language, asserting that African cultures can develop using their own languages.He says in the book, no country can achieve its developmental objectives using foreign languages.Mrs Nyoni and Mr Gondo look at two forms of heritage, tangible and intangible while in another chapter, Dr Mazuruse gives a summation on all the ethnic groups found in Zimbabwe.Mrs Nyoni and Mr Gondo proffer advice to teachers on how to teach African languages unpacking different teaching methods which can be explored.A full professor now with a PhD in Language Education from the University of South Africa (UNISA), Professor Magwa has published 25 books and made over 100 publications in academic journals and position papers. The publications are based on literature, language, education and culture.He has received a number of accolades, among them being voted Winner of the World Education Award for outstanding contribution in Bombay, India in 2013.The former Gweru Teachers College, Midlands State University, Zimbabwe Open University senior lecturer said his book is already on the market and can be accessed in all Mambo Press Bookshops throughout the country and RCZ Mabhuku Bookshops.@walterbmswazie2
