From Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls A citizen writer based in Hwange, Lawrence Pen Pusher Moyo has penned a collection of poems in Nambya which he hopes will contribute towards beefing up reading material for minority languages. The poems have been published in a book titled Jiti baNambya (The Nambya have landed) and could be the first ever poetry collection in the language.The country s Constitution provides for recognition of 16 languages which should be examined in schools.However, uptake has been slow in some minority languages such as Nambya, Chewa and others because of lack of literature.A member of the Press Writers Association, Moyo put down a collection of 20 poems in Nambya, dominant in Hwange district. I collected the poems to highlight our day to day lives and also to promote the Nambya language that was slowly losing it lustre, said Moyo.The poems have a variety of themes that reflect day to day life. Pasha Pezhoba (home without peace) talks about domestic violence and Siya Mwana (leave the child alone) focuses is on child sexual abuse. Fukula (the gossip monger) is a tale of rumour mongers who go around gossiping about other people instead of minding their own business, said Moyo.He said he is working on an animated version of Fukula.Moyo said he hopes to make a contribution to the new education curriculum through his poetry set which he feels should be part of set books. You will realise that there is a shortage of Nambya books in schools hence this book can narrow the gap. Scholars in Hwange appreciated it as the poems appeal to both children and adults. They are rich in language including local proverbs, he said.Moyo said the book being his first, marks his journey towards contributing to the preservation of the language.@ncubeleon
