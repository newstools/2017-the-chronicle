Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AS part of the new school curriculum introduced by the Government, the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) Matabeleland North Province will today conduct an athletics course for primary school teachers and coaches in Lupane. Naaz Matabeleleand North chairman Enock Ngwenya said they expected teachers from across the province to attend the course aimed at capacitating them with requisite skills. We view this course as a way of capacitating teachers and coaches. As you know, athletics now starts at Early Childhood Development (ECD) level as a result of the new curriculum. As Naaz, we are giving the teachers information they will impart to the little ones, said Ngwenya, who is also the deputy headmaster of Thomas Coulter Primary School in Hwange.He said the course will be facilitated by Victoria Falls-based Augustine Sibanda and his Lupane counterpart Bigboy Chauke. These two guys were part of a large group that attended a training workshop in Harare which was conducted by a German expert, so they will now disseminate what they learnt to the rest of the teachers. We sent invites to all the schools in the province and I hope we are going to have a big turnout, Ngwenya said.
