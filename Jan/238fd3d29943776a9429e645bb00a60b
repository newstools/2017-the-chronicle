We were focusing on three main things, administration, competition and technical aspects of the sport. We believe that this will help us achieve our targeted goals within the specified time frames as we hope to map our way forward. We would like to express our gratitude for the support we got from NIF and Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) in putting together our plan, said Sithole.He said the meeting also provided opportunities to reflect on some areas that need polishing in volleyball. This plan helps to set direction for the ZVA to influence our decisions so that we can strengthen our organisation, develop the sport of volleyball and find a way to connect the many communities which share a passion for the sport. We have a tight calendar ahead and we hope to implement all the outcomes of the meeting in all our activities, he said.The last part of the workshop will be conducted on March 3.@khumzallen
