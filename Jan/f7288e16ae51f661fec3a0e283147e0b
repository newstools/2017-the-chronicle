Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE Government has installed a solar water pump in Ntalale area of Gwanda South ending a six year water crisis by bringing tap water to households. Before the solar water pump installation, Ntalale villagers had to walk for over 15 kilometres to Tuli River to fetch water for domestic use.UKAID in partnership with the Ministry of Water, Environment and Climate as well as project implementers Interconsult and Sesani Pvt Ltd installed the solar water pump in November last year.Villagers who spoke to The Chronicle said they were relieved to have clean water at last. The past six years were difficult for us. We didn t have water to drink and had to walk several kilometres to fetch water for drinking and domestic use. We were exposed to water borne diseases for a long time because the water we were drinking was not healthy at all. Now we have clean water coming out of our home taps. We are very grateful to Government and donors, said Ms Laiza Moyo of Ntalale village A.Another villager, Miss Khanya Nyathi said the project started in October and by Christmas they were having water in their homes. It was pretty fast. We could not believe that a problem we had for such a long time could be solved in such a short space of time. The Government has finally answered us and wiped away our tears. We are so happy, said Miss Nyathi.The area s headman, Mr Donald Sibanda, said the availability of water will also enable villagers to establish nutritional gardens in line with the Zim-Asset blueprint cluster to ensure food security at household level.@richardmuponde
