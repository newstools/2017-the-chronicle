Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Zimbabwe Consulate in South Africa has warned locals to be wary of dubious characters inviting people to the neighbouring country promising them good jobs. Zimbabwe s Consul-General to South Africa, Mr Batiraishe Mukonoweshuro, said they were disturbed at the rate at which Zimbabweans were being duped of their hard earned money by conmen in South Africa.He said fraudsters or human traffickers were involved in some of the fake job advertisements. We always urge those willing to do business to contact the Trade and Investment Promotion Officer at the Consulate for any assistance or verifications required, he said.Mr Mukonoweshuro said at the moment they had identified one of the conmen as Wallace Dube.He said Dube has been running advertisements in Zimbabwe indicating that he was hiring boilermakers, electricians and fitter and turners for jobs in South Africa.Mr Mukonoweshuro said the man was sending people emails inviting them to South Africa under the guise that he had secured jobs for them at Orkeny Gold Mine in North West province. He charges those without work permits R6000 alleging that he has an agent who processes the permits for R12 000, and that he will pay the other R6 000 for a few shortlisted candidates. In one of the adverts he said the work permits would be processed in two weeks and the prospective candidates should travel to South Africa on February 3 for medical examinations and start working. He is a fraudster and people should ignore such kind of messages, said Mr Mukonoweshuro.He said those willing to travel or study or work in South Africa should contact the consulate rather than rely on dubious characters.Mr Mukonoweshuro said Dube was busted before he could dupe more people and they were still checking with the police if there were any other pending cases against him.Recently, four Zimbabwean men were rescued by South African police from a 25-year-old South African man who had illegally trafficked them into that country after promising them good jobs.Raymond Sithole of Chebeng village near Polokwane City has since been charged with human trafficking.He will appear before a Seshego magistrate on February 1.
