Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter STEADY Hwange defender Tonisani Sibelo has set his eyes on joining Bulawayo giants Highlanders after severing ties with the coalminers early this week. Sibelo (25), who still had a year remaining on his contract with Hwange, requested and was granted a clearance letter by the club, which still owes him last year s signing on fees and winning bonuses. The right-back, who possesses immense qualities both on the ground and in the air, said he now wants to don the black-and-white stripes and believes he can add value to Bosso in their quest for the league title. My wish now is to play for Highlanders, a team which makes every player eager to play for them. I know it s not a given that I will impress the coaches because the club has many talented and experienced players, but I believe I also have what it takes to fit into the squad, said Sibelo. I have already asked and been given my clearance letter by Hwange and am ready to move to Bulawayo, he said.With Bosso eyeing the league title this year, coach Erol Akbay will do with a squad made up of seasoned campaigners blended with talented youngsters.Veteran Tendai Ngulube, a natural midfielder, was shifted to right-back last season by the coaches following the injury to Benson Phiri, himself a midfielder.Young Nkosana Ndlovu, who had a dream debut for Bosso at right-back in their 3-0 thrashing of Hwange last season, still has the future ahead of him and the coaches might choose to protect him by not throwing him into the deep-end this early. @skhumoyo2000
