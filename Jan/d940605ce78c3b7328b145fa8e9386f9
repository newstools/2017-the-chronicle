Emmerson MnangagwaLovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent A ZIMBABWEAN delegation left for Belarus on Sunday to follow up on the $150 million mega deals Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and investors from that country signed in 2015. Zimbabwe concluded the $150 million investment deals with Belarus that will see the country receiving machinery and equipment for mining, construction and agriculture sectors.The delegation consists of officials from the Government, Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara), rural and urban authorities, and District Development Fund (DDF)Zinara chief executive officer Mrs Nancy Masiyiwa-Chamisa said the delegation would source equipment for roads rehabilitation and maintenance from the East European country. We have a programme already in place where all the constituencies that is Zinara, DDF, urban and rural councils will be represented by a team which has gone to Belarus to work on the modalities on how best we can acquire equipment for road maintenance from that country as part of the $150 million loan facility. We expect the team back in the country on January 26 after which we will then map the way forward, she said.Once sourced, the equipment is expected to go a long way in helping maintain roads in rural and urban councils which are in a state of disrepair.The development comes as some local authorities have appealed to Zinara to avail them graders so that they can rehabilitate some roads in their localities.Kwekwe Mayor Clr Matenda Madzoke said there was a need for Zinara to avail graders so that council can maintain roads in high density surbubs. As council we would appreciate a situation where we have funds availed for other projects which are not part of the projects recommended by Zinara that council deems necessary. We would also be happy if we can have some graders which can rehabilitate our roads especially in the high density surbubs most of which are no longer navigable, he said.His sentiments were also echoed by Gokwe Town Council secretary Ms Melania Mandeya who said the local authority s roads were fast deteriorating because of the rains.
