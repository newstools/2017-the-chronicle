Richard Ngarava, famously dismissed with the Mankad at the last ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, has been included in the Zimbabwe A squad preparing to host Afghanistan A for a five-match one-day series in Harare. The lanky left-arm seamer is one of the new faces in the 16-man Zimbabwe A squad that will, however, be finalised after a fitness test today.The 19-year-old Ngarava was the victim of a Mankad dismissal that made headlines and incited arguments and debate across the cricketing world in February 2016.Some of the newcomers in the squad also include former Under-19 skipper Brendon Mavuta, Tendai Maruma and Ryan Murray.The Zimbabwe A squad is expected to begin camp next week ahead of the first match slated for January 27 at Harare Sports Club.Mavuta led the Zimbabwe Under-19 team at the previous ICC World Cup in Bangladesh where Zimbabwe crashed out in the group stages courtesy of the Mankad dismissal when they needed three runs off the last over with a wicket in hand.Neville Madziva, Tapiwa Mufudza, Victor Nyauchi, Prince Masvaure, Brandon Mavuta, Carl Mumba, Prince Masvaure and Tendai Chatara are some of the players in the A squad.According to cricket website Cricinfo, a Mankad dismissal is when the batsman at the non-striker s end has backed up out of his crease and the bowler removes the bails in his run-up with the batsman out of his crease. Technically the dismissal falls under the run-out category.The most famous instance of this mode of dismissal came when Vinoo Mankad ran Bill Brown out in the Sydney Test in 1947-48. Mankad, in the act of delivering the ball, held on to it and whipped the bails off, with Brown well out of his crease. Sportszone.co.zw
