What we want to do is build a team for the future, meaning that focus will be on adding youngsters, he said.Kaindu declined to reveal the names of players whose contracts ran out, but Chronicle Sport has it on good authority that midfielders Tawanda Muparati and Fungai Chirinda as well as defender Victor Kamhuka are yet to renew deals with the gold miners.Skipper Tapiwa Khumbuyani, midfielder Thembani Masuku and national team reserve goalkeeper Donovan Bernard s contracts also expired at the end of last year.Former national team and Highlanders midfielder Peter Rio Moyo, whose contract with South African National First Division side Witbank Spurs expired last year, is among the new faces that have already signed for How Mine.The gold miners are also expected to find a replacement for Amini.@ZililoR
