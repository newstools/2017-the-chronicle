Mzoe 7 and Sandra NdebeleBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent After spending the better part of last year preparing to sit for her O-Levels and looking after her one-year-old baby, Sandra Ndebele says she is back in the game. This time she returns through a single called Ingoma that features Mzoe 7 and produced by Oskid.Sandy, as she is affectionately known by her fans, was in Harare last week at Oskid s studios with Mzoe 7 recording the song.This week the duo was shooting the video for the song in Bulawayo with some scenes at the Centenary Park.Describing the song as a dance tune, Sandy said it was the first in the many that she will release this year ahead of her album. I now have more time to spend and I want to make good that time so that s why I m back in the studio to release an album at the end of the year. So Ingoma is one of the tracks that are going to be on the album. I ll be releasing singles until the album is launched, said Sandy.She said the track would be released next month. I first want to complete the video of the song. This is because when the song is released also there is a music video for people to watch. So mid next month I ll release the song, said Sandy. She said she was anxiously waiting for the release of the O-Level results as she sat for Mathematics last year in November.Kwasa Kwasa hit-maker Mzoe 7 said he was at a loss for words as he had not imagined that one day he would have worked with Sandy. It s not always that legends like Sandra can work with up- and-coming stars. So for me it s a big honour to be working with people who have always inspired us when we were growing up, said Mzoe 7.
