The players did well in Namibia and we re now looking forward to the Africa Tennis junior Championships in Benoni. We had five players securing automatic qualification, while three are waiting for the ITF to give them the green light to compete in South Africa on a wild card entry.Claire Machisi, Charlotte Zhuwakini and Thabo Ncube will be hoping the ITF grants them wild card entries to fulfil their dreams. Going forward, we have to work on our shortcomings. Technically we matched our opponents and had the ability to dominate play, but we struggled to finish out the points, especially during crucial games. Our doubles let us down in the team events and we need to work hard to improve. There is also need to work on the players mental strength as well so that they don t lose focus and concentrate throughout their respective games, said Mufunda.Zimbabwe finished third at the Zonal Championships behind champions South Africa and Madagascar, thereby missing an opportunity to compete in the Fed Cup and Davies Cup.Twelve countries, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mauritius, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia took part in the Windhoek tournament.@ZililoR
