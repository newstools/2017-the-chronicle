Charity Ruzvidzo The 2017 learning season kicked off recently with both teachers and learners striving to understand the newly introduced curriculum. The new curriculum, which is premised on producing a more diverse and well-equipped learner, came as a welcome innovation to most Zimbabweans who aspire to see the education sector being tailor-made to meet the dynamic demands of the post-independence era.However, although analysts have commended the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education for introducing the curriculum changes, they expressed concern over the hurried and haphazard manner in which the changes were being implemented.Analysts believe the new curriculum is only implementable at more infrastructure-capacitated schools and practically impossible to adhere to at most rural schools that still lack basic necessities like decent classrooms, furniture and books, not to mention electricity and internet connectivity.Disciplines such as Science and Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Information Communication Technology and Heritage studies are part of the major thrust of the new curriculum.A survey conducted by the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union (ARTUZ) indicates that most schools in rural areas are incapacitated to successfully implement the new curriculum.President of the ARTUZ, Mr Obert Masaraure, said the survey was conducted in the country s eight provinces. Teachers in the sampled schools revealed that they had not schemed because they do not have the syllabi, said Mr Masaraure. There is apparent lack of infrastructure to implement the new blueprint. No electricity for compulsory computer programmes, no laboratories and textbooks for the content to be taught. Given such, the learner in the rural areas is at a disadvantage compared to their urban counterparts who are lucky enough to have the appropriate resources at their schools, the survey notes.In addition to unavailability of decent learning structures and equipment, teachers in rural areas do not have incentives to motivate them.It is pivotal for a teacher to have the necessary requirements in order for him/her to produce the expected results.The survey further indicates that rural areas schools are understaffed.New subjects have been introduced yet the number of subjects remains unchanged. Integrated Science teachers are now forced to teach physics, biology and chemistry, read part of the survey findings.Zimbabwe s literacy rate is one of the highest in Africa.Analysts say the Government must focus on safe-guarding this record by sparing a thought to the learning environment surrounding the rural pupil.The new curriculum takes into consideration the impact of information and communication technologies and their drive towards an information driven economy.The new skills that make use of ICTs, are meant to enable citizens to live and work competitively in the global village.The major challenge for the rural learner in the face of acquiring information communication skills would be the unavailability of electricity in most rural areas.Rural electrification is still an ongoing process and most areas are yet to be connected.The way forward, according to Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe national co-ordinator Mr Ladistous Zunde, is to provide a substantial budget towards the implementation of the curriculum and incentivising rural teachers. There must be budgetary support towards the implementation of the new curriculum especially in rural areas. Even schools in urban areas are still grappling with the new curriculum implementation. Imagine, the situation in rural areas where some schools do not have computers and adequate infrastructure, said Mr Zunde.Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) chief executive officer, Mr Sifiso Ndlovu, said teachers have the capacity to implement the new curriculum with adequate training. To suggest that teachers are not ready is not the right interpretation. Teachers simply need more time to be trained in order to familiarise with the new curriculum. Resources should be availed to do this for rural and urban teachers, said Mr Ndlovu.Mr Masaraure said his union was lobbying, through Parliament, for resources to be channelled towards the successful implementation of the curriculum in rural areas.He said they were also inviting developmental partners to assist in rural areas learning system s development.The curriculum is founded on notions of inclusivity, accessibility, equity, relevance, continuity, respect, gender sensitivity, transparency and accountability.It is through the notion of inclusivity that rural learners should partake at the same pace with some of their urban counterparts in benefiting from the new curriculum.Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Dr Lazarus Dokora brushed off the survey conducted by ARTUZ. Irrelevant matters at week one of the implementation, said Dr Dokora.The new curriculum is organised into three learning levels which are: infant school, which starts at Early Childhood Development (ECD) up to Grade Two.Junior school, starts from grades three to seven and it reinforces foundational skills and begins to introduce pupils to life and work skills.Secondary school, that is Forms One to Six, prepares pupils for various options including university education, technical and vocational training programmes, apprenticeship and civil service as teachers, nurses, army officers and police officers.The new curriculum is set to prepare learners for a largely agro-based economy and increasingly globalised environment; encourage lifelong learning; and promote patriotism, participatory citizenship and sustainable development, among other objectives.The curriculum is expected to transform Zimbabwe s learning environment for the better and create more competitive citizens.
