But Pearl s father is a very angry man.BECAUSE ROBERT HASN T PAID ILOBOLO!Bhekizizwe Thusi, a Durban taxi boss, spoke to the People s Paper.Everything looks glitzy for the two love birds.But Pearl s dad is reeling with anger and disappointment.He accuses the Marawa family of disrespect.He says they are ignoring the fact that they must pay ilobolo for his daughter.Bhekizizwe told Sunday Sun: The Marawa family treats Pearl as their makoti. But they haven t united the two families in the traditional way. And I m still waiting for the Marawas to come for ilobolo negotiations. The angry taxi boss told the People s Paper: Pearl told me about the engagement. But she didn t say when the Marawa family were planning to pay ilobolo for her. In my family, ilobolo is paid. And only then can they claim our daughter as their makoti. I get the impression this family undermines me as Pearl s father, he said.But the old man said he s not planning to call the Marawa family and ask for ilobolo payment. Why should I go to them? They know how we do things as traditional people. They know they must do the right thing. And the Marawas have a background of rural life. They know exactly what they must do. Pearl hasn t said anything to me about the wedding. I don t know. Maybe, they got married without my knowledge, said Bhekizizwe. Daily Sun.
