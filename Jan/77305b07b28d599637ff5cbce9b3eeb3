Tanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter A SENIOR Zanu-PF official from Bulawayo Nacisio Elijah Makhulumo has been fined $100 for not reporting to the police that his firearm was missing. Makhulumo pleaded guilty to failure to report a missing firearm when he appeared before Bulawayo Provincial Magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya on Thursday. I m sure you are aware of the dangers that may come with not securing a firearm. You are lucky that no one killed someone with it. You need to take more caution in securing it.

The money has to be paid to the Clerk of Court on or before January 31.
