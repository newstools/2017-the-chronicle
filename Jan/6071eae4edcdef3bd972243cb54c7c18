Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIFA Central Soccer League champions Shabanie Mine have appointed former Bantu Rovers coach Mandla Lulu Mpofu as head coach. Mpofu has penned a three-year contract with the Zvishavane side to replace Tendai Chikuni, who joined Gweru-based PSL outfit Chapungu United.Shabanie Mine chairman Elias Marufu confirmed Mpofu s appointment, saying he brings traceable experience to the club. I can confirm that we have appointed Mandla Mpofu as the club s head coach on a three-year contract. We settled for Mpofu since he is someone who has coached in the Premiership for a long time and knows the demands of the league, said Marufu. As a club we were also looking for someone who has experience in coaching a community club and Mandla has that experience with Highlanders where he was assistant coach and again he knows the pressures of such institutions and we have confidence that he will deliver. He said they had given Mpofu a target of a top eight finish for the 2017 season in the PSL, if their promotion is confirmed, and a top four finish in the 2018 season. If things go well for us, we want to challenge for the league title in 2019. As you know, the club is a big institution, which has a huge following and it is only through being ambitious that we can push the brand, Marufu said.Shabanie Mine s Premiership status remains in limbo as the PSL and Zifa squabble over the promotion and relegation issue.Despite a Zifa extraordinary general meeting resolution that two teams be relegated from the PSL and four be promoted, the topflight league seems determined to pursue the matter with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.@lavuzigara1
