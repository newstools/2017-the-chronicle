Killer TShowbiz Reporter COMPETITION at the Zimdancehall Awards 2016 seems to be stiff with Winky D leading in terms of nominees with seven followed closely behind by Seh Calaz, Freeman and Killer T. After a good year, the four artistes have chances of landing awards in the various accolades that are in each category.Song of the year will be a contentious one as Killer T s Takangodaro was the anthem last year, with Winky D s 25 and Soul Jah Love s Hove Huru in the running. Despite her making a comedian lick her feet last year as punishment for ridicule, Lady Squanda features four times in nominations including ironically, the Zimdancehall Ambassador category.Check out the full list below:BEST MALE ARTIST1.
