Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent ZIFA Central Soccer League side MSU has dissolved its executive chaired by Tino Muzikamwi following an indifferent 2016 season. MSU has named Themba Chingwena as the new head coach following the non-renewal of John Phiri s contract at the end of last season.The Varsity Sharks who had been touted among the favourites to land the championship last season after bringing on board some big names such as Smart Muchabaiwa, Farai Mususunye and Bastos Chihowa flattered to deceive, finishing the campaign of sixth position.MSU who managed to collect 50 points were 19 points adrift of winners Shabanie Mine whose premiership status has now been confirmed.The university s director of sports, James Muvirimi Chivivi said: I can confirm the dissolution of the MSU FC executive committee after failing to get the desired results last season. We are going to be appointing a new executive very soon which will for the first time incorporate two seasoned administrators from the Gweru community. On the appointment of Chingwena, the MSU sports director said they had decided to recall their former coach as he understood the MSU culture and had the same vision as the institution, that is to nurture talent of the students. We have retained him because we share the same vision, that is having the bulk of the club dominated by students. Previously he had done well when he took over the club and I believe he will take over from where he left from, Chivivi said.Chingwena was once roped in as MSU coach during the midseason break of 2015 following the sacking of Varsity Sharks entire technical department then led by Joseph Michael following a string of poor results.He salvaged the campaign which saw MSU ending the season on fourth position with 51 points.However, the coach did not last long after Zifa introduced new minimum requirements for coaches to sit on the bench in division one which the soccer mother body set at Caf C.This saw the gaffer, who then had a Zifa Level 4 coaching course, falling by the wayside and was replaced by John Phiri.Chingwena returns with a Caf B licence. @lavuzigara1
