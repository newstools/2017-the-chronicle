Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter MORE than 80 swimmers will converge at Hillside Teachers Training College tomorrow morning for the fifth Matabeleland Junior League Swimming Gala. The gala will feature seven clubs, Petra Swimming Academy, Zambesi Tigers, Barracudas Swimming Club, Crusaders Swimmers, School of Swimming, Dolphins and Penguins Swimming club.Matabeleland Swimming Board chairperson Nokuthula Cyprianos said they expect a tough competition, as swimmers will be preparing for the provincial championships set for the Bulawayo City Pool from February 11-13. Our swimmers have been training hard since this is the last junior event before the Matabeleland Junior Championship Gala. This is the time for every swimmer in the province to impress and perform at their best so that they can make it to the provincial team. Soon there will be a provincial team selection so everyone will want to be part of it and the only way to do so is through one s performance, said Cyprianos.She said they expected records to tumble at tomorrow s gala. We expect better times and more records to be broken. There has been an improvement in the performance of our swimmers, especially in the 10-year age group. They have really become our strongest group in the province. Some of the names to look out for in the competition are 10-year-old Onesimus Ngwenya from Penguins and Barracudas Onovo Onye. These youngsters have really shown some improvement in their respective categories and I hope they will continue improving in future competitions, said Cyprianos.Barracudas will be hoping to continue their dominance in the Matabeleland Junior League Gala after emerging tops in last week s competition. @khumzallen
