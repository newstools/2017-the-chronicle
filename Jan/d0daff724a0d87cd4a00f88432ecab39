After that we ll start planning seriously for the wedding that we want to have at the end of the year. Hopefully the after party will be at Tshisanyama, said Eddie.Asked when and for how long they has been dating Eddie said he met Theodora a year ago through DJ Liz who is her best friend. She worked in Harare and would come over to Bulawayo to spend time with family.
