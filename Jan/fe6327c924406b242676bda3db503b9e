Sukulwenkosi Dube- Matutu, Plumtree Correspondent A MANGWE man allegedly hanged himself from a tree after failing to stomach the pain of losing his job. Bulilima Mangwe officer responsible for crime, Superintendent Pedzai Dzindimu said Jason Mlalazi (34) of Ingwizi Township was last seen by his neighbours on Friday last week.He said his body was found hanging from a tree in a bushy area the following day by two women who were collecting firewood. I can confirm that there is a man from Ingwizi Township who was found hanging in a suspected case of suicide. Jason Mlalazi s body was found hanging by a rope from a tree in a bushy area close to Ingwizi Business Centre. Mlalazi left his home on Friday morning for an unknown destination. The following day at around 10AM two villagers were collecting firewood when they found the body. His body didn t have any injuries, he said.Supt Dzindimu said investigations were underway to ascertain why Mlalazi decided to end his life. He said his body was taken to the United Bulawayo Hospitals mortuary for post mortem.Supt Dzindimu said police were encouraging people facing problems to seek help instead of resorting to suicide.A village head from Ingwizi area, Mr Jabulani Moyo said Mlalazi hanged himself soon after losing his job at a security company. Mlalazi was staying alone at his house because he was not originally from Mangwe. He was working for a security company until he was retrenched two weeks ago. This unfortunate development seems to have affected him because he started drinking heavily ever since. Some of his friends said that he even mentioned that he would take his life as he didn t have any means of sustaining his family. I think that his job loss affected him a lot to the extent that he saw suicide as the best option, he said.Mr Moyo said Mlalazi was originally from Nkayi.@DubeMatutu
