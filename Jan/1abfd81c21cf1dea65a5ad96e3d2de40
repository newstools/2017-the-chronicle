Prof Welshman NcubeNduduzo Tshuma, Political Editor THE Coalition of Democrats (CODE) has hit troubled waters over reported side negotiations between the Professor Welshman Ncube-led MDC and MDC-T which threaten the broader coalition ahead of the 2018 polls. According to sources, parties under CODE met recently and raised dust over the alleged negotiations between Prof Ncube s party and MDC-T, with the meeting expressing anger at what they called acts of deceit by MDC.Under the proposed deal the MDC will be allowed to contest in three constituencies in each of Matabeleland s three provinces of Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South. MDC-T will not field candidates in the nine selected constituencies.It was further revealed that People s Democratic Party (PDP) leader, Mr Tendai Biti, whose party is yet to officially join CODE but attended the meeting, was fuming at what he reportedly called prostitution by political parties.Prof Ncube, according to insiders, did not attend the meeting but sent party spokesperson Mr Kurauone Chiwayi who was asked to explain the party position. When asked to explain reports of an MDC/MDC-T merger, Chiwayi said only Prof Ncube and party secretary general Miriam Mushayi could shed light on the matter. Biti had no kind words for the MDC, saying some political parties were now literally prostituting themselves ahead of the election period, said a source.Renewal Democrats of Zimbabwe leader, Elton Mangoma, who was also part of the meeting, said he had asked Prof Ncube about the matter and the MDC leader denied that there were any such negotiations with the MDC-T.Despite initial denials by MDC that they were negotiating with MDC-T, informed sources within the party yesterday confirmed that Prof Ncube notified the national executive of the process. Contrary to their denials, Prof Ncube informed the national executive of his party at their meeting on December 22 that negotiations to merge with MDC-T were ongoing. In the same meeting, Prof Ncube revealed one of the MDC-T vice presidents, Ms Thokozani Khupe, was against the merger, said a source.PDP spokesperson, Mr Jacob Mafume could neither deny nor confirm the reports saying his party was yet to officially sign to be part of Code. However, in an indication of simmering tensions over the MDC/MDC-T merger, Mr Mafume called on parties to negotiate for a coalition in a transparent and principled manner.He said Zimbabwean politics had not moved from smoke filled processes where parties negotiate with transparency and principles. We have to be transparent and principled in everything we do otherwise at the end some parties will be unhappy as happened after the negotiation of the Government of National Unity, said Mr Mafume.
