Bab chairman Manuel Mpofu believes they have selected the best squad as all selected athletes reached qualifying times in a cross country event that was held at Luveve High School in Saturday. We had a great competition and we came up with a team that will represent the province next month in the national championships. It was a tough competition and the cream of the day managed to make it into the provincial team. This is the best team that we have because they were selected according to the qualifying times. Right now our focus is preparing for the nationals because we really need to impress as we are the hosts, said Mpofu.He said the team is expected to have its first training session this Saturday at White City Stadium before it heads to Hillside Dams to familiarise itself with the route and terrain on February 4.Bab teamCadet girls: Buhle Nyoni (Mpopoma High School), Lucy Fuyana (Ingubo Primary), Ratidzo Nyathi (Ingubo Primary), Talent Sibindi (Mpopoma High), Samantha Ndlovu (Mpopoma High), Mercy Fuyana (Ingubo Primary)Cadet Boys: Gamuchirayi Mutimusakwa (Mpopoma High), Luckmore Mpofu (Malindela Primary), Hillary Sibanda (Ingubo Primary), Quinton Chivimbiso (Ingubo Primary), Sibusiso Moyo (Ingubo primary), Makabongwe Sibanda (Inkanyezi Primary)Juniors women: Tatenda Ndlovu (Mpopoma High), Londis Ncube (Northlea High), Patience Gurure (Sparrows), Yvonne Mutare (Ihlosi athletics club), Yvonne Mpofu (Northlea High), Christabel Nyathi (Luveve High).Junior men: Dumo Mkhwananzi (Sparrows), Witness Mangwiro (Sparrows), Nigel Ncube (Northlea high), Freedom Banda (Sparrows), Tafadzwa Zhou (Northlea High), Mhlengi Ncube (Luveve High)Senior women: Anne Chirisa (Fairbridge), Faith Sikhosana (School of Mines), Linet Tom (ZRP), Sandra Taderera (Sparrows), Brenda Banda (Northlea high),Senior men: Trust Chidomaya Fairbridge), Baberton Mhlanga (Fairbridge), Willard Mutasa (Jumbos Athletics club), Ubert Dube (Fairbridge), Denford Mlilo (Sparrows), Philemon Mudzinganyama (Jumbos)Coaches: Thulisile Dube and Sicino MpofuTeam manager: Musawenkosi Thabane.@khumzallen
