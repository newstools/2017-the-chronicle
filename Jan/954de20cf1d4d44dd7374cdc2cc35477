Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter MEMBERS of the newly appointed Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) board were inducted this week, with Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane spelling out 10 key areas of their three-year mandate. The three-day induction workshop was held in Kadoma concurrently with the commission s first official statutory board meeting during which Lillian Mbayiwa was elected deputy chairperson. She will deputise Edward Siwela. The mandate is going to guide the operations of the SRC for the next three years and our hope is that we will get the necessary support from the various stakeholders that we work with because sport and recreation are an integral part of our social fabric and as such stakeholder buy in cannot be underestimated, said SRC acting director-general Joseph Muchechetere.One key mandate agreed on was to ensure that the bidding and hosting of games by national sports associations is done in line with developed policy.The Zimbabwe Aquatic Union (ZAU) was the first sport association to be censured for successfully bidding to host the CANA Zone IV Swimming and Waterpolo Championships in Bulawayo from February 16-17 without following protocol.ZAU was accused of trying to secretly host more than 10 countries for the championships without following official protocol.The other mandate of the new SRC board includes enforcing good corporate governance across the sport and recreation sector after Hlongwane declared 2017 the year of governance in the sector.The board is also expected to develop an effective funding model for the SRC, facilitate for registration of all sport and recreation facilities, and to ensure compliance with standards.There was also emphasis on thorough preparations and effective participation in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games and ensuring that the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee and Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee are supported. @skhumoyo2000
