Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ANOTHER top Highlanders official faces the wrath of the Zifa executive for allegedly equating the agreement between the association and players to a dog sale agreement. The official, who is a member of the Highlanders Royals executive committee, has often been critical of the Phillip Chiyangwa-led Zifa executive and is a close ally of a member of the Warriors technical team suspected of leaking the handwritten agreement signed by Chiyangwa, his deputy Omega Sibanda, Warriors skipper Willard Katsande and striker Cuthbert Malajila.It was signed on January 7 after the Warriors refused to disembark from the team bus to attend a State organised send off ceremony at a Harare hotel at which then Acting President Emmerson Mnangagwa was guest of honour.The ceremony was eventually called off after the players dug in demanding their outstanding allowances from the Africa Nations Cup qualifiers.The denigrating message was sent through a WhatsApp chat group where a former Zifa official based in Matabeleland North also responded in a sarcastic manner criticising the association. While the conversation was in a private chat group, the (Zifa) presidium feels it was an unnecessary attack by someone in football administration. Investigations will also be carried out to find out who actually took the picture of the agreement and forwarded it via WhatsApp. It s strongly believed that it s a member of the Warriors technical team, said a source.The official is likely to be suspended and will become the second high ranking Highlanders official to be sidelined by the association following the suspension of club chairman Peter Dube in November 2016.
