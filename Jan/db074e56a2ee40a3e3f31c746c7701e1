Luis SuarezBarcelona striker Luis Suarez insists the Catalans are &#8220;obliged&#8221; to chase down Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, despite losing more ground on the European champions in a 1-1 draw at Villarreal on Sunday. Even a fabulous last minute Lionel Messi free-kick couldn&#8217;t prevent Barca falling five points behind Madrid, who also have a game in hand, after Nicola Sansone had put Villarreal in front just after halftime.The draw capped a poor return to action in the new year for Barca after losing the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday.&#8220;We are aware that we are Barcelona and we are obliged to fight for all the titles,&#8221; Suarez told Spanish TV station Movistar.Barca host Bilbao in the return leg on Wednesday hoping to avoid a first Cup exit to anyone other than Madrid since 2008.&#8220;What matters now is the Cup game on Wednesday,&#8221; added Suarez.&#8220;We have to go out from the first minute to win the game and qualify.&#8221;Suarez had an unusually quiet night in front of goal as most of Barca&#8217;s opportunities fell the way of his strike partners Neymar and Messi.&#8220;They have shown all season that they are very difficult to play against at home. We had our chances in the second-half, but we couldn&#8217;t take them until Leo&#8217;s goal,&#8221; added Suarez.&#8220;We&#8217;ve let two points get away, but we just have to keep working hard.&#8221;Barca boss Luis Enrique believed his side had done enough to win the game despite a familiar lack of cutting edge up front and fragility at the back this season.&#8220;Without doubt I think we deserved to win the game,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We played well. We are not on the most positive run and you have to do more to win these type of games, but I have no criticism for my players.&#8220;They played a complete game and we deserved the three points.&#8221;And with still over half the league season to go, Enrique insisted Barca still have time to chase down Madrid.&#8220;There is still half the season to go and I am sure we will have the chance to fight for the league,&#8221; he added.&#8220;The only chance we will have to fight for the title, though, is by getting back to winning soon. To keep playing like this but with a different result.&#8221;Off the field, rumours emanating from Croatia claimed on Sunday that Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic could be on his way to Manchester City after being left out of Enrique&#8217;s squad.However, Barca vice-president Jordi Mestre said the Croatian was &#8220;loved&#8221; at the Camp Nou and that negotiations were ongoing to extend his contract beyond 2019.&#8220;We are negotiating Rakitic&#8217;s renewal,&#8221; Mestre told Movistar.&#8220;We love Rakitic as a player and as a person. At the moment he has a contract and is a Barca player.&#8221; AFP.
