Siphethangani SibandaNhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent BULAWAYO disc jockey Cp, real name Siphethangani Sibanda, was crowned the best female DJ in the city at a competition held at Club 263 on Saturday night. The competition had more renowned names in deejaying such as DJ Noma That Girl, Miss P and Crazy D.DJ CP, who walked away with $130, relegated Crazy D to second place .Competition was so tight that the judging panel, headed by Skyz Metro FM s Benkosi Bkay Maphosa, had to bring them back on the decks to get the top female DJ in the city in a 10 minute tie breaker.It s from the 10 minutes tie breaker that DJ Cp emerged the winner much to the excitement of the full house.While it s known that Bulawayo patrons are fans of house and Hip-hop music, DJ Cp went an extra mile and caught them unawares as she belted out Nigerian, Reggae and Zimdance-hall music.DJ Cp who is just a year old on the decks, is also a resident DJ at Walkers Pub. Asked to comment on her win, DJ Cp said: This came as a shocker, I wasn t confident. I ve only been disc jockeying for a year. The competition was tough as some of the DJs I was competing with are seasoned and very experienced .The competition is part of an initiative to discover talent among female DJs in the city and demystify stereotypes associated with female DJs. I m very glad to be given such a platform to showcase my talent as most female DJs don t get such a platform, said DJ Cp.
