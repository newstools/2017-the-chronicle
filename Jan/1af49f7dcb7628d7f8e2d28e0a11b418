After our zonal competitions, we will come up with a squad for the district competitions set for the same venue from March 2-3 where we will have 26 schools from Tsholotsho in attendance as we use the event to select a district team to represent Tsholotsho in the Matabeleland North athletics finals set for Nkayi High School from March 16-17, Dube said.Matabeleland North will then join the other nine provinces for the national finals set for Lomagundi College in Mashonaland West province from March 30-31.Matabeleland North province needs to improve its performance at national level as it has always struggled despite the vast talent at its disposal.Lack of proper fields and equipment in most schools was identified as a major contributing factor to the province s poor showing.The province has one standard athletics field in Hwange and although some schools have upgraded their tracks to standard distances, it s the quality of the tracks that still lacks with a number of tracks still of sand.The province emerged ninth with five gold, six silver and nine bronze medals at last year s nationals in Chiredzi.
