Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ISAAC Nyabvure has been appointed ZPC Munyati coach, as the Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) outfit bolsters its technical staff ahead of the new season. ZPC Munyati had a disappointing season last year, finishing fourth from bottom after collecting 28 points from 30 games under the guidance of Rutherford Matondo.Club secretary Emmanuel Gengezha said they had settled for the former Lancashire Steel midfielder and Ivan Hoe coach Nyabvure on a one-year deal. We have appointed Isaac Nyabvure on a one-year contract. The contract is subject to renewal based on his performance and for this year we have set a target of a top three finish, said Gengezha.The power generators will be hoping Nyabvure can inspire them to repeat their 2015 season feat during which they were among championship favourites and even led the league table at one point.Their campaign went off the rails towards the end and they ended up securing a third place finish.The departure of Nyabvure from Ivan Hoe has seen the club starting the hunt for a new coach. We only heard that he was in talks with ZPC Munyati without talking to us and this clearly shows that his heart is no longer with the club. We are therefore looking for a new coach at the moment and we are still accepting CVs from potential coaches, said Ivan Hoe secretary Itai Munyanyi.Meanwhile, Gwanda-based CSL side Vumbachikwe has also set in motion plans to replace head coach Max Ruza after another disappointing season that saw them finishing ninth.Vumbachikwe chairman Amos Mbengari said they were hunting for a new coach, but Ruza would be accommodated elsewhere in the technical structure.@lavuzigara1
