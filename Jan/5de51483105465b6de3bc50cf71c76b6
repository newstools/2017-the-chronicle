Mkhuphali MasukuSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HARARE City FC are on a collision course with Zifa for defying a standing order that only Caf A licence holders can coach Premier Soccer League teams, with the Sunshine Boys insisting that Caf B holder Mkhuphali Masuku is their new head coach. Masuku took over from Moses Chunga who cut ties with the municipal side less than a year after replacing Taurai Mangwiro.Ironically, Mangwiro is implementing the requirement on behalf of the national association in his capacity as Zifa technical director.Harare City secretary-general Matthew Marara said they were not losing sleep over an informal declaration as they were yet to receive formal communication from Zifa on the new position. Masuku is our head coach; we have confidence in his coaching abilities. I have seen coaches taking charge of Premiership teams without the said qualification, hence our position will not change regarding Masuku, said Marara.He said his club was not even considering an option in the event Zifa makes its position formal. As Harare City, we have not seen any communication from Zifa to the effect that all Premiership coaches must have a Caf A qualification. I will not speak on behalf of other clubs though, maybe they have received that communication, said Marara.Masuku missed a recently held Caf A course in Harare as he was with the national team in Gabon for the Total Africa Cup of Nations finals.Despite not having the requisite Caf A licence, Masuku has gained enough experience at the highest level, having been in charge of Bulawayo giants Highlanders, Caps United and a spell at Chicken Inn.Last year, Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda told aspiring Caf B licence participants in Bulawayo that all PSL coaches will this year be required to possess Caf A licences.Meanwhile, Harare City rejected reports that they are set to bring on board former Warriors coach Callisto Pasuwa as head coach. Those are just rumours; no one has talked about Pasuwa in our executive as we have a capable bench led by Masuku, said Marara.
