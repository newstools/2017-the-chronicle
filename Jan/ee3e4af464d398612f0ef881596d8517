The association will be having a sprints seminar to be conducted by an expert from Botswana. We engaged the Botswana Athletics Association (BAA) and the coach will be jetting into the country on February 2. One of our main objectives is high performance and the only way to do that is to engage people who have participated at high level competitions. Otsetswe is one of the best coaches in the region and he will be coming here to share his experiences in athletes with us, said Tagara.He said the workshop would be open to anyone interested in athletics, but NAAZ was mainly targeting sprint coaches and sprint athletes. The association hereby invites all school teachers and all athletics coaches to attend this event. We encourage everyone to take part as this is an opportunity to expose our athletics teachers to the best world trends. Otsetswe is good in that field and I am certain our local coaches will benefit a lot from him, said Tagara.He said participation fees had been pegged at $50, which will cater for lunch, refreshments, administration and certification.Tagara also said accommodation would be provided for participants from outside Bulawayo.@khumzallen
