Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) and representatives of the Ministry of Sport and Recreation are scheduled to meet the Zimbabwe Aquatic Union (ZAU) leadership for feedback on the union s needs ahead of the hosting of the Cana Zone IV Swimming and Waterpolo Championships. The championships will be held in Bulawayo from February 16-17, but preparations have been hit by a number of administrative and technical hiccups, beginning with ZAU s failure to notify the government of its intentions to play host to the championships as per etiquette.Selection of Team Zimbabwe for the event has also raised eyebrows, with allegations that one s financial muscle determined selection at the expense of talent. The SRC has since briefed the Ministry of Sport and Recreation on the state of affairs and we await their feedback. The SRC will meet with ZAU together with the Ministry of Sport and Recreation so as to get further feedback on areas which they require government support, said SRC spokesperson Tirivashe Nheweyembwa.Parents have been asking why they should use personal resources yet the Government has previously funded other athletes on international duty, with the latest being the African Union Sports Council Region Five Games held in Luanda, Angola.Swimmers were asked to pay for their own accommodation, meals and other sundries at a total cost of $490 each for those staying in a hotel and $215 for those with own accommodation.This is in addition to the $10 annual CANA levy each of the more than 500 swimmers have been paying since 2014.
