With the rains upon us, we are optimistic of a bumper harvest, he said.Chief Chireya of Gokwe North said Government had also done well by availing extra fertiliser in the wake of the continued rains.He said both the maize and cotton crop were doing well. While the crops have been doing well, the rains are now a bit too much and farmers can t attend to their crops. At the same time we have three tractors stuck in the mud because of the heavy rains.
