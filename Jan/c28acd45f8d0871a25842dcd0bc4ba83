Lawrence MhlangaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CHICKEN Inn and Warriors defender Lawrence Mhlanga has snubbed a move to top Zambian club Power Dynamos, as he hopes to attract better offers after the 2017 Afcon tournament that starts in Gabon tomorrow. Sources said Power Dynamos, who finished fourth in the Zambian league last season, had made contact with Chicken Inn last month inquiring about the availability of Mhlanga and the Gamecocks had given him permission to hear the offer.Former Railstars and Zimbabwe Saints coach Anderson Phiri, who also assisted Tenant Chilumba join FC Platinum in 2012, was reportedly behind Power Dynamos attempts to lure Mhlanga to Zambia.Sources said the player s camp turned down the offer, with Mhlanga focusing on the Afcon. Power Dynamos did contact Chicken Inn and they gave the Zambians the green light to talk to the player. Mhlanga through his manager Gibson Mahachi felt that he may get better opportunities other than Zambia after the Afcon tournament and that is why he turned down Power Dynamos advances, said the source.The Chicken Inn defence stalwart is competing for a starting place in the Warriors central defence against Costa Nhamoinesu of Sparta Prague in Czech Republic, Dynamos Elisha Muroiwa and his Chicken Inn teammate Teenage Hadebe.Following Dynamos defender Elisha Muroiwa s howler in the friendly against Cameroon that resulted in a penalty, Mhlanga may fancy his chances of partnering Nhamoinesu in central defence and enhance his chances of impressing scouts.Chicken Inn secretary-general Tawengwa Hara confirmed that Power Dynamos had expressed interest in their player before referring questions to Mahachi. As a club we feel we re doing well if our players attract the attention of foreign clubs and as per our club policy, when an opportunity arises for a player to go for greener pastures, we don t stand in their way. As such, Mhlanga is the one who has the final decision, but I think you can talk to his manager (Mahachi) on what decision he made, said Hara.Mahachi declined to go into detail about the Power Dynamos offer. Yes a top Zambian club expressed their interest in Lawrence, but unfortunately I can t comment further, said Mahachi.Kitwe-based Power Dynamos are bankrolled by Copperbelt Energy Corporation, which also has interests in Nigeria and Namibia. @ZililoR.
