Tanaka Mrewa, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has reversed its decision to move baboons that had been terrorising some residents in Pumula South suburb as they were no longer going to people s homes. ZimParks had earlier this month said it would conduct an awareness campaign as a measure to deter baboon-human conflict and then capture and translocate them as a secondary measure.A ZimParks spokesperson said after they conducted an assessment, they concluded that the animals were no longer a menace in the area due to abundant food following recent rains.The Chronicle news crew visited the area yesterday and residents confirmed that baboons were no longer raiding their homes for food.The spokesperson said ZimParks officials held an awareness campaign with residents on January 22 and notified them of the latest development.He said ward 27 councillor Siboniso Khumalo and over 80 people residents attended the meeting. The issue of capturing and translocating the baboons has been shelved since they are no longer coming due to the abundance of food in the wild. It will be resumed once they become a menace again, he said.He said it was emphasised that residents should immediately report cases of human-wildlife conflict as soon as they occur. ZimParks facilitators from the public relations office and extension and interpretations emphasized on proper disposal of leftover food which was the pull factor for baboons. Residents were advised to keep their leftover food in secure and baboon proof containers until the Bulawayo City Council garbage collector vehicle comes, he said.@tannykay
