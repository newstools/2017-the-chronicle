Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FINANCIAL muscle was allegedly used to select Team Zimbabwe for the Cana Zone IV Swimming and Waterpolo Championships set for Bulawayo from February 16-17, with some deserving swimmers whose parents could not afford the high fees being left out. The clandestine selection process is against the Government s position of equal opportunities for all in sport.Angry parents said they were told to fork out $490 for those who will be staying in hotels during the tournament, while those putting up elsewhere had to part with $215.According to a document, which is in possession of Chronicle Sport, sent to parents, those choosing option one (own accommodation) will pay $50 for lunch and snacks, $20 tour shirts, $25 management fees, $20 as incidentals/entry fees and $100 for Cana levy.Hotel accommodation has been put at a minimum of $75 per night per person in a four person room and a maximum of $120 for a single person room. I wonder why these people are being allowed to personalise swimming in this country. Elitism must not be used when selecting athletes, but we want merit. Deserving swimmers have been left out because their parents cannot afford these charges. In any event why should an athlete pay to represent his or her country, said one parent.Zimbabwe Swimming Board of Control chairperson Lorna Riley refused to entertain inquiries from Chronicle Sport.More than 10 countries are expected to take part in the Cana championships.
