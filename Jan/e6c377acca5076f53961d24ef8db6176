If we can have our own people supporting the genre, it makes it easier to export. It s time we also saw Zim hip hop represented on Africa s big stages like the MTV Base awards and the Hip Hop Awards so I am calling on all hip hop lovers in Zim to come to the show and support the movement because from here we are taking the show to the rest of Africa. The 10 shows which have been organised in partnership with Zimboi are promising a performance that will go down in the history books so hip hop lovers don t want to miss out on this one.
