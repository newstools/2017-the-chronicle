We ve a number of people of all ages who drown during the rainy season because of the inexistence of proper crossing points at our rivers. Some of the bridges are dilapidated and don t serve their purpose thereby making it difficult for vehicles to get across, said Chief Hobodo.He said due to the heavy rains being received in the area at the moment, members of the public are encouraged not to underestimate water levels in water bodies as this has resulted in drowning incidents.National Police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said due to the rise in the number of drowning cases during the rainy season, members of the public are urged to exercise caution when crossing rivers. It s disturbing to note that some people are swept away while trying to cross flooded rivers. Some will be casting fishing nets while some parents leave infants near uncovered buckets of water and unprotected wells thereby increasing the vulnerability of children, said Snr Asst Comm Charamba.She also warned of the increased risk of being attacked by crocodiles. Travelling while it is raining or hiding behind objects and under trees is discouraged as people risk being struck by lightning, said Snr Asst Comm Charamba.@cchikayi
