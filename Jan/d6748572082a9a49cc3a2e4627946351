Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FIFTY participants have registered for the Bulawayo-based Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz) training camp for out-of-contract players that starts today at the Heath Streak Multi-Sports Centre in Suburbs. The five-day training camp is meant to help out-of-contract players secure clubs following Fuz s initiative to invite Premiership and First Division clubs to send their scouts to the camp.Brazil-trained gaffer Dalubuhle Bhebhe, former national team winger Joel Luphahla, ex-Highlanders and national team defender Dazzy Kapenya and goalkeepers coach Peter Nkomo will conduct the training camp.Fuz president Desmond Maringwa said they had lined up speakers that will talk about player management. This programme is meant to help our players find opportunities. We will just prepare them for what to expect and have also invited clubs so that they come and fish for talent. What we ve realised is that at times a player has talent, but lacks discipline or understanding of some things and for that reason, we re going to have presenters talking to the participants, said Maringwa. We re going to have Itai Kapini doing fitness and health tomorrow, with a match official coming to talk about the rules of the game and we will also have a topic on match fixing as well as contracts, he said.Maringwa said they would be happy if a player manages to secure a contract after the training camp.He also revealed that the Harare camp which had 90 participants saw six players being spotted by FC Platinum, Dynamos and Black Rhinos.Bhebhe challenged players to take the programme seriously, adding that they had crafted their training sessions to suit scouts. Five days may not be enough but in consultation with the clubs representatives, our programmes will bring the most out of the players. What players need to do is take this programme seriously because it s one of a kind and players also need to appreciate the efforts made by Fuz in helping them secure jobs, Bhebhe said.Among those who have registered for the Bulawayo programme are ex-Highlanders and Triangle United defender Dumisani Fazo Ndlovu, formerHow Mine left-footed utility player Moses Gutu, Munyaradzi Mungadze of Hwange and left-back Julius Daudi whose contract with Highlanders expired on December 31.@ZililoR
