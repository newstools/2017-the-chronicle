Lovemore Zigara in Gweru KWEKWE-based Ivan Hoe sprung to the top of the Zifa Central Soccer League table after dispatching Silo United 2 0 at the weekend. Goals by Elton Njanji and Albert Goredema ensured the Amaveni side collected maximum points to stretch their unbeaten run to six matches.Ivan Hoe now sit on 30 points and took advantage of a slip-up by Tongogara, who went down 1 2 to ZPC Munyati.Julius Chakupewa, the Ivan Hoe coach, said he is happy with his side s achievements and emphasised the need to manage his lads to hold their nerve towards the home stretch. I am happy with the way we have performed so far, but being on top of the log standings has its own pressures. So going forward, I will need to manage players because they can get complacent easily. It is still a long way to go, but I hope we will continue with the fine run, said Chakupewa.In Munyati, Isaac Nyabvure s ZPC Munyati had to come from a goal down to beat Tongogara 2 1. The power generators got their goals from Jacob Muzokomba and Lucky Makura, while Simon Chishanga scored for the army side.It was sweet victory for ZPC Munyati, who had gone for five games without a win. I hope the win is the turning point and that we start collecting more points, said Nyabvure.His Tongogara counterpart Kelvin Maphosa conceded defeat and promised that his charges will bounce back in their next game. It was a good game, but we failed to preserve our lead and were punished. However, it is not the end of the world and I am confident we will post a positive result in our next match against Gwanda United, said Maphosa.Results Chrome Stars 1-0 Vumbachike, Ivan Hoe 2-0 Silo United, ZRP Gwanda 0-2 FC Platinum Under 19, Makusha 3-2 Kwekwe Stars, Blanket Mine 0-2 Nichrut, ZPC Munyati 2-1 Tongogara, Gwanda United -1 Border Strikers, MSU 0-0 Whawha, Telone 0-0 Black Eagles @lavuzigara1.
