Joshua BondoSikhumbuzo Moyo,Senior Sports Reporter DISGRACED Botswana referee Joshua Bondo will on Friday take charge of a Caf Champions League match between Sudan s El Hilal and Clube Ferroviario da Beira of Mozambique at El Hilal Stadium. Bondo will be the centre referee barely a week after his disgraceful ejection from the Cosafa Castle Cup tournament following poor officiating in the Group B encounter between Zimbabwe and Madagascar at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Wednesday evening in which he made numerous erroneous decisions mostly against the Warriors.The highlight of his pathetic handling of the match was his blatant denial of two clear penalties to the Warriors after Raphael Manuvire and in-form co-captain Ovidy Karuru were felled inside the box late in the game with the two teams tied at 0-0. The Warriors technical team wrote a strongly-worded complaint letter over the referee s conduct soon after the game.The 39-year-old, who also hogged the limelight earlier this year for head butting an Angolan player when he officiated in their international friendly against South Africa, was sent home by the Cosafa organising committee following a review of his pathetic officiating by the referees committee. Decision by the referees committee and organising committee was to return the referee home, said Cosafa s Lynda Greeff.Bondo will handle the match with countrymen Oamogetse Godisamang and Mogomotsi Morakile.
