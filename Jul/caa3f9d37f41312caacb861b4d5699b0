Councillor Sifiso MpofuLeonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter VICTORIA Falls mayor Councillor Sifiso Mpofu has bemoaned drug abuse by youths in the resort town. Speaking at the commissioning of a 900-seater Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe (AFMZ) church in Chinotimba suburb on Saturday, Clr Mpofu said the church should help fight drug abuse and crime. This town is small but we have many youths who are dying because they abuse Bronco, a cough mixture which they use as alcohol. As a society we are worried about the rate of crime especially murder cases committed by youths. The church should pray especially for our youths so that they don t commit these heinous crimes, said Clr Mpofu.He, however, acknowledged that the church was already playing a big role by luring youths to church.The mayor challenged citizens to go beyond just attending church but live by the word of God.AFM president Asper Madziyire said the society was suffering because of crime and sin. Many are living in a season of sin hence the church should speak the vision of salvation so people can see. This is a chosen generation but it is suffering because of delinquency, he said. @ncubeleon.
