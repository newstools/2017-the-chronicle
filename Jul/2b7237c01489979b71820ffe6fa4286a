In their past six meetings in Bulawayo, Dynamos only won once, 1-0 in 2016, and have played to three draws against and lost twice, 1-0 in 2012 and 3-0 last season.The players to watch for Dynamos on Sunday are winger Mandiranga, Mukamba and Epoupa, while Chicken Inn will bank on defenders Guide Goddard, Moses Jackson, Passmore Bernard and Divine Lunga.Chicken Inn also have gritty defensive midfielder Thabani Goredema, seasoned midfielder Clemence Matawu and striker Darryl Nyandoro to bank on.Obadiah Tarumbwa, who scored a brace when Chicken Inn beat Dynamos 3-0 last year, has slim chances of playing on Sunday as he has fallen down the pecking order behind Nyandoro, Ishmael Lawe and Thomas Kadyaridzire.
