We appreciate Government s efforts in paying the civil servants their bonuses as promised. We, however, hope that the situation will improve. We want a situation where civil servants receive their salaries and bonuses on time. We re also hoping that all civil servants benefit from the housing projects availed because this is a way of incentivising them and enhancing their livelihoods, said Mrs Alexander.Cash flow challenges have seen Government shifting pay dates for civil servants.Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira is on record as saying Government is committed to paying civil servants their dues and improving their welfare.In January this year, Government had offered its workers three payment options to settle the bonuses.These included residential stands, a cash stipend coupled with non-monetary benefits and property investment bonds.The workers rejected all the options and threatened to demonstrate against their employer, resulting in the Government calling the workers for negotiations.The deal to pay them in cash was sealed in March when Government met civil servants representatives.@pamelashumba1
