I ve no beef with POY hence we included him for this concert, said Cal_Vin.That Luveve Boy, as Cal Vin is affectionately known, said the concert was being held to promote hip hop and as such he was paying all the artistes.POY The young guys that usually have to perform for free will be rewarded. It might not be a lot of money because I m paying from my own pocket, Cal_Vin told our sister paper B-Metro last week. The whole point of the concert is to grow hip-hop in the city and create excitement in the same way that festivals such as Shoko do in Harare. My travels, especially to Germany last year, inspired me because those people have a whole lot of festivals that actually pay the young artistes, he said.
