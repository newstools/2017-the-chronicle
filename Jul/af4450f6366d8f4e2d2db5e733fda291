Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) has elected a new executive that will serve up to 2021. The new executive is made up of six members with Darlington Chasara coming in as the president, Admire Chafa is the new secretary-general, Charmaine Chirinda (competitions manager), Sinda Mono (Technical director), Tatenda Mumbengegwi (Marketing and Promotions manager) while the athletes commission consist of Mbulelo Mangoma and Estele Masiyambumbi.Mumbengegwi said their first mandate as the new executive is to create vibrant basketball competitions especially at primary and secondary schools. We are very honoured to be given such a responsibility to lead the association and we promise to work very hard to ensure we carry on where the out-going executive left. The first thing on our wish list is to work hand-in-hand with the National Association of Primary Heads (Naph) and National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) so that we create a very vibrant junior policy in Bulawayo. Right now there are just few schools that play basketball so our pool of players is very limited. Once we are able to achieve that we will then send clubs for competitions outside the country, said Mumbengegwi.The outgoing BBA executive was made up of Opportunity Moyo (president), Ndumiso Mabhena (technical director), Haward Phangwana (secretary-general), Handsome Ndlovu (competitions manager), Tracy Phiri (marketing and promotions), Charmaine Chirinda (Women and youth) and Pretty Tinarwo who was the athletes commissioner.@khumzallen
