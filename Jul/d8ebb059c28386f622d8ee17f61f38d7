Trinity Sibanda (second left), Zodwa Wabantu s Byo twin with Food Lover s Market staffBULAWAYO s own Zodwa Wabantu &#8211; Trinity Sibanda &#8211; who was last Friday voted the best impersonator of South African dancer Zodwa Wabantu &#8211; seems to be enjoying her moment of fame in the city. Trinity brought business at Food Lovers in Bradfield to a standstill after members of staff and clients identified her having breakfast with a friend and jostled to take pictures with her.One of the customers said he could not wait to watch Trinity and the real Zodwa Wabantu performing on the same dance floor. Zodwa, a party freak who recently rose to fame after attending the Durban July clad in a revealing dress with no panty on, is expected to party at Club Connect in Bulawayo on Saturday where she will be joined by her impersonator. I was there when Trinity won the battle and I m excited to see her again here (Food Lovers), this time without the skimpy dress that crowned her the Zodwa Wabantu of Bulawayo. I can t wait to see the two on the same dance floor, said one of the people who met Trinity at Food Lovers.The competition where Trinity was crowned Zimbabwe s Zodwa Wabantu was themed Dress and Dance like Zodwa Wabantu and was held at Club Connect last Friday ahead of the visit by the Mzansi socialite to the same club this Saturday.Trinity came out guns blazing dressed in a figure hugging black dress that revealed her tattooed thigh resembling the one Zodwa wore at Durban July. For her efforts, she walked away with a $300 prize money from the club management and more than $2 000 from clients who were charmed by her dance moves and dress code. Focus
