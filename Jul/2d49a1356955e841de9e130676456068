Elvis MoyoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE heavyweight cage fighter Elvis Bulawayo Bomber Moyo is confident of beating Britain s Stuart Austin at Sun City in Rustenburg, South Africa, on July 8. The potentially explosive Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) Africa 61 bill will be broadcast across the continent on Kwese TV.The South African-based Moyo returns to the ring after four months, having last fought in March when he knocked out Mike Vermeulen at Carnival City in Johannesburg.In a telephone interview from his Johannesburg base yesterday, Moyo said he had been working hard to shed weight from 120kgs to 116kgs for the fight. I m on my fighting weight which is 120kgs, but I want to shed off about four kilograms so that I m quicker on the day of the fight. If I can manage to lose 4kgs, I ll be happy, said Moyo.Moyo is eager to beat the Briton and take his Mixed Martial Arts career wins to nine.Moyo has eight career wins from 12 bouts.A win against Austin will enhance Moyo s chances of getting a title fight before the end of the year.Moyo lost to Andrew van Zyl in October 2016, but recovered from that defeat to knock out Vermeulen in two minutes 40 seconds in March this year.Austin has 11 career wins and three defeats. The Briton last fought in October 2016, knocking out Nills van Noord in the UK.Austin last tasted defeat on May 14, 2016, when he went down to Mark Godbeer.About his opponent, Moyo said: I know little about him besides that he is an Olympian having represented his country in judo. I m really excited about the opportunity to face an opponent of his calibre. Last year I fought a wrestler from Japan and had no problems with it. I think this fight will be more of a boxer versus a wrestler, similar to that of Ali versus Inoki in the 1970s. The late boxing great Muhammad Ali fought against professional wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 in a bout that inspired the launch of mixed martial arts. It was the first time a boxer had taken on a martial artist and although the bout was scored a draw, Ali suffered damage to his legs.@ZililoR
