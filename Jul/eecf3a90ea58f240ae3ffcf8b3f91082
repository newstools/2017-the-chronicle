Minister Walter ChidhakwaSenior Business Reporter THE Government has started allocating chrome claims secured from Zimasco beginning with smelting companies that are set to receive 7 000 hectares of the claims under phase one of the plan. Small-scale miners were also expected to get about 10 000ha of chrome claims under the second phase.Mines and Mining Development Minister Walter Chidhakwa is on record saying the Government would allocate part of the chrome-rich idle concessions released by chrome mining firms to smelters whose operations were being hampered by shortage of feed stock.Through the use-it-or-lose-it policy, the Government targets to repossess up to 40 000 hectares of chrome rich but idle ground largely held by Zimbabwe major chrome producers, Zimasco and ZimAlloys.Under the first phase on the allocation of 50 percent of chrome claims the Government possessed from Zimasco, beneficiation of the base metal is considered imperative.A source within the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development said the Government has already started allocating the chrome claims repossessed from Zimasco.Minister Chidhakwa could not be reached for comment last Friday while his deputy Mr Fred Moyo s mobile phone was not being answered.Chrome mining is the second largest employer after gold in the small-scale mining sector.The Government once banned chrome exports, in 2011, with a view to encourage beneficiation of the metal, but lifted the ban in 2015, as stockpiles hit 30 million tonnes and affected viability of miners who could not find a local market due to low smelting capacity.The country is anticipating to double chrome ore production this year to 550 000 tonnes from 284 943 tonnes in 2016.Ferrochrome (refined chrome ore) production is also expected to rise to 300 000 tonnes from 149 000 tonnes.Last year, Zimbabwe realised $115 million from the export of 149 000 tonnes of ferrochrome while $31 million was earned from the export of 284 943 tonnes of raw chrome.
