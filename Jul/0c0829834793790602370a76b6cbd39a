Madinda NdlovuSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter TROUBLED Hwange FC are reportedly lining up an audacious bid for football legend Madinda Ndlovu following the shock dismissal of coach Nation Dube and his assistant Mebelo Njekwa this week. Ndlovu is in charge of Orapa United that finished third in the Botswana top league and has previously won league titles with Township Rollers and Mochudi Centre Chiefs in that country.Hwange were left with no coach this week following the decision to relieve Dube and his bench of duties although there was confusion yesterday as goalkeepers coach Chenjerai Dube and fitness trainer Kenny Nyape were still in charge and conducting training sessions. This was despite the fact that the club issued a statement saying the whole technical bench had been booted out. The fact that the entire technical bench makes a technical team it means they cannot be isolated from their results as individuals when in fact they were working as a team sharing the same vision and strategy. It is not about an individual but the team as a whole, read part of the statement released by the Hwange Colliery Company corporate affairs manager Rugare Dhobhie.She however did not respond to questions on who will replace the fired coaches saying the executive committee is currently engaged in a process to ensure the best candidate will take the club to the next level . Once a decision is taken, on who is taking over, it shall be communicated, read the statement.However, sources at the coal mining giant said there were plans to bring in a clean person who can also command respect from the players and appeal to the community and the Botswana based Ndlovu s name was suggested.He led Orapa United to the Mascom Top 8 title in 2016 before they lost their crown in the final to Jwaneng Galaxy this year, losing 3-4 after extra time. Madinda s name has been thrown around and he seems to be fitting the bill compared to Luke Masomere who has had stints with the club before. An iconic figure like Madinda coming to this town will obviously lift these boys spirits but we are not sure whether the company will afford him, despite showing signs of financial recovery, said a source.Other names that have been touted include Bigboy Mawiwi, Masimba Dinyero and Bongani Mafu.Ndlovu s last coaching stint in Zimbabwe was in 2009 when he was in charge of Highlanders with Philani Mabhena as his assistant. @skhumoyo2000.
