Knox MutizwaSikhumbuzo Moyo in Sun City, South Africa Lesotho 3 &#8211; 4 Zimbabwe MAN of the match Knox Mutizwa scored a memorable hat trick in a tightly contested Cosafa Castle Cup semi-final match against a determined Lesotho to send the Warriors into a potential mouth-watering final against Zambia on Sunday.The Bidvest Wits and former Highlanders hitman kneed the opener in the 19th minute off a corner kick by Innocent Mucheneka as the Warriors grabbed the early goal as per their game plan.Mutizwa scored his second five minutes after the breather to restore the four-time Cosafa Castle Cup winners lead after Likuena had levelled matters in the 41st minute through dreadlocked substitute Samuel Ketsekile.The Warriors went three-up when Talent Chawapiwa dispossessed Bokang Sello before riffling the ball into the roof of the net that left Lesotho goalkeeper Likano Mphuthi clutching thin air in the 63rd minute.An element of complacency coupled with fatigue allowed Lesotho to score their second goal when Mabuti Potloane scrambled the ball home 10 minutes before full time.Mutizwa restored the Warriors two-goal margin in the 82nd minute following a solo run by co-skipper Ovidy Karuru, but Lesotho were not done and pulled one back from the penalty spot after Potloane was felled inside the box by Orlando Pirates target Honest Moyo deep into injury time.Tsoanelo Koetle converted the spot kick emphatically, giving keeper Takabva Mawaya no chance. We went to sleep after taking the lead on both occasions and Lesotho punished us, said Sunday Chidzambwa, the Warriors gaffer after the match. His Lesotho counterpart Marai Mpitsa said: My boys played well, I can t complain, but the two mistakes at the back cost us badly.
