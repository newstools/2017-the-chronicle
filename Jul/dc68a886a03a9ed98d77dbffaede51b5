Ovidy KaruruSikhumbuzo Moyo at Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace, South Africa Swaziland 1-2 Zimbabwe KNOX Mutizwa rose from the bench to score a beautiful header in the 78th minute that propelled Zimbabwe to their fourth semi-finals of the Cosafa Castle Cup at the expense of Swaziland last night.The Bidvets Wits striker, with a knack for scoring crucial goals at Golden Arrows where he was on loan last season, came in for young Prince Dube in the 66th minute, with the two teams tied at 1-1 after Swaziland s Felix Badenhorst had cancelled Ovidy Karuru s 17th minute opener for Zimbabwe. Mutizwa headed in a well taken corner kick by co-skipper Ocean Mushure as Swaziland seemed content on pushing the game into a penalty shootout.Badenhorst capitalised on a lapse by the Warriors central defence of Jimmy Tigere and Liberty Chakoroma just three minutes into the second half. We gave away an easy goal due to poor marking from one of my central defenders, but we had a good first half in which we created a number of goal scoring chances, said a visibly relieved Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa, who is yet to lose a Cosafa match with the Warriors.Last night s win marked the 10th victory out of 13 Cosafa matches for the revered gaffer.The tournament s leading marksman Karuru shot Zimbabwe into the lead in the 17th minute when he reacted quickly to side foot a cross from the right, leaving Sibonakaliso Vilakati, the Sihlangu goalkeeper, a bemused man.Zimbabwe continued to enjoy better ball possession and on the half hour mark, Prince Dube shook his head in disbelief after his flicked ball beat the goalkeeper and the upright.A momentary lapse by the Warriors defence almost gifted Swaziland the equaliser, but Badenhorst s grounder from inside the box went wide. We had a good second half against a very strong and good Zimbabwe side. It s unfortunate that my players failed to defend after I had told them to be wary of set pieces because Zimbabwe has very good takers, said Swaziland coach Pieter De Jongh, who also felt referee Victor Gomes from South Africa was a bit harsh on his players.Zimbabwe will now take on Lesotho in the semi-finals on Wednesday.Teams Swaziland: Sibonakaliso Vilakati, Nkosingiphile Tsabedze, Siboniso Ndzabandzaba, Felix Badenhorst, Bonginkosi Dlamini, Xolani Sibandze (Sifiso Matse 46th min) Mcolisi Lukhele, Phinda Dlamini, Siboniso Dlamini (Sibonginkosi Gamedze 84th min), Machawe Dlamini, Samkelo GumbiZimbabwe: George Chigova, Michelle Katsvairo( Talent Chawapihwa 54th min) Ocean Mushure, Eric Chipeta, Gerald Takwara, Ovidy Karuru, Prince Dube(Knox Mutizwa 66th min) Raphael Manuvire (Innocent Mucheneka 71st min),Honest Moyo, Liberty Chakoroma
