The VP was the guest of honour at the three-day 7th Buy Local Summit and Investment Forum in Victoria Falls.The top 100 local brands awards were organised through the Buy Zimbabwe initiative to promote local content, a new drive meant to buttress the Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016 and encourage citizens to buy locally produced goods and services.Those honoured have kept at least 30 percent local content in selected products and have demonstrated procurement from local manufacturers and service providers.The top brands also offered significant support towards the local economic growth through fiscus contributions, employment creation, infrastructural development and relevant value chain linkages while also maintaining a proven market resilience and a superior brand position.VP Mnangagwa, who condemned the notion of preferring foreign goods to locally made products by citizens, commended the winners as torchbearers of domestic economic policy.
