Tendai ChikuniLovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU coach Tendai Chikuni says he will be searching for new players in the lower divisions in a bid to bolster his squad in this mid-season transfer window. He said the search would have a Gweru bias, as he seeks to make Chapungu a truly Gweru outfit. Chikuni said he would not make too many changes to the team, but will include players he did not register in the first half of the season, such as Patrick Khumbula and Marvellous Dikinya. When we started the season, we had players we did not register through injuries and we might see one or two coming through. The cause of concern is the attack, but we will not make wholesale changes because that will destabilise the system, said Chikuni. I did not release some of the players like Khumbula and Dikinya because they understand the system. They will definitely feature in the second round of the season. We are also going to look at some players from Division One because I believe that there is a lot of talent in the lower league. Look at Ian Nyoni we got him from ZPC Munyati; he has been a revelation for us and we will continue to scout for new talent. We also need to groom players from Gweru. We will not continue importing players from elsewhere. I have been watching a lot of schools soccer and I have been impressed by the talent we have.&#8221;@lavuzigara1
