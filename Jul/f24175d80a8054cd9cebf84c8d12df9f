Pitso MosimaneMamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane and goalkeeper Denis Onyango both praised the club s Caf Champions League quarterfinal advance. The Brazilians saw off Ethiopia s St George 1-0 last weekend courtesy of Anthony Laffor s late strike in difficult conditions in that country.Nonetheless, Mosimane takes the view that his side had the pedigree to get the job done in the end, while keeper Onyango was more emotional about the result. We have the experience (in Caf) and you could see we controlled the ball in the second half. We have players who play for Bafana Bafana, so we controlled, he told reporters. I worked for St George before, but when I came back it was for Sundowns, Onyango added. I thank the supporters because when I came out for the warm-ups they clapped for me. They were welcoming and it was very emotional. Downs, who have one more match in Group C against AS Vita Club before the final stages, are second to Esperance, who are at home to St George. The final round of games could decide who comes out on top and potentially gets an easier draw in the quarterfinals. Supersport.
