Dumisani Nsingo, Senior Business Reporter ZIMBABWE Applied Arts in Crafts Association (ZAACA) has engaged the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO) to relax some of the stringent patent requirements to enable craft producers to protect their artefacts invention for better returns. ZAACA chairperson, Mr John Custom, said most local craftsmen were failing to obtain real value from their artefacts due to the cumbersome and expensive nature of patenting it, culminating in the products being used, sold or imported without their permission.He said this after a media tour of Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre in Bulawayo yesterday. We have talked to certain organisations like ARIPO to waiver some of their requirements because the list of their requirements is very long for someone to patent his or her product, he said.Mr Custom said crafts have over the years managed to improve the livelihood of a number of people.The head of the pottery section at Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre, Mr Sipho Ndiweni, said the institution had managed to train numerous craftsmen that have gone to sustain their livelihood through various forms of art such as pottery, ceramic sculpture, wood and stone sculpture and fine art. We are under Bulawayo City Council s vocational training centre and our responsibility is to facilitate training. We train students from Bulawayo and surrounding areas. We are not largely focusing on selling but training students to acquire the requisite skills, he said.Mr Ndiweni said graduates were expected to create their employment on leaving the training centre. Some of our graduates who have made it in this art industry are abroad in countries such as South Africa while others who are here are producing for the export market, he said.
