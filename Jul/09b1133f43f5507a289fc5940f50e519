Last weekend, Ezimnyama shrugged off competition from nine other groups at Manor Hotel and earned the ticket to represent Bulawayo at the national finals where $4 000 is up for grabs. Runners-up stand to get $3 000 and $2 000 for the third-placed group.It is second time lucky for Ezimnyama who landed the provincial title in 2015, but did not win the national crown.The 14-member group is now looking forward to clinching the title on their home soil.Ezimnyama director Phibion Ncube said they would make the province proud at the national finals. We ve started rehearsals for the national finals at White City Stadium and we promise to land the national crown, said Ncube.He said they were improving on their previous mistakes. After we lost last year, we went back to the drawing board. We now know where we went wrong and we also changed our main dance this year from Muchongonyo to Setapa found in Matabeleland South province. This we re guaranteed will separate us from the rest, said Ncube.Their Chibuku Neshamwari provincial win came exactly a week after one of their dancers, Dadirai Mupandawana, landed the Outstanding Female dancer accolade at the Bulawayo Arts Awards. This win shows that we re doing something right as a team.
