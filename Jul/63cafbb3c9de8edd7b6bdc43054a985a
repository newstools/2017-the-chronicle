Rovers defence of Lindelani Vice Ncube, Dumisani Sibanda, Kudzaishe Dzingwe and Tapiwa Khumbuyani is expected to provide cover for either Nonjabulo Dube or Wellington Muuya who will guard their goal.The defence will have to deal with the experienced FC Platinum attackers who include newly signed trio of Takesure Chinyama, Mkhokheli Dube and Ali Sadiki.FC Platinum also have Charles Sibanda, Marshal Mudehwe and Gift Mbweti who are equally dangerous when venturing upfront.The platinum miners should be wary of Rovers attackers Nyasha Garai, Lucky Ndlela, Brighton Ncube and left footed midfielder Marvin Sibanda. In the reverse fixture FC Platinum beat Rovers 3-2.Rovers skipper Ndlela said: Every game is a challenge to us and an opportunity to show what we ve got.
