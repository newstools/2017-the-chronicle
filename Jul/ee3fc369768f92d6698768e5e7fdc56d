Ellina Mhlanga, Sports Reporter NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe director in charge of youth, Briad Nhubu, has said their focus going into the upcoming IAAF World Under-18 championships in Nairobi, Kenya is developing their athletes. The championships will run from July 12 to 16 and Zimbabwe are fielding seven athletes &#8211; four boys and three girls.The boys team will be led Donavan Mutariswa, who was in Tlemcen, Algeria for the African Junior championships, Alfred Chawonza, Simbarashe Maketa and Tapiwa Makarau.Vimbai Maisvoreva, Arage Mutombo and Mascline Watama will compete in the girls section.Nhubu said while they would want to emulate the juniors who walked away with nine medals at the just-ended continental championships, it s going to be a tough assignment for the youths in Kenya. Most of the events we are competing in, we are going to meet Kenya at home, Ethiopia also and Eritrea. So I know we will have a tough time. If we reach the semi-finals that will be a big achievement because it s a big event as compared to African championships. So if they manage to get to the next stage from the heats to us it will be an achievement. Yes, we have had exposure in regional competitions but most of them it s their first time at the World Youth Champions. So if they can push their times in terms of performance that will be good for us. I am happy that the juniors managed to bring something home, gold, silver and bronze. But these juniors have actually come from the youth programme. So it s a development programme where the youth get exposure, said Nhubu.Mutariswa was part of the 4 x 100m boys relay team that won gold at the just ended African Junior championships, in Tlemcen, Algeria as well as Watama, who competed in the girls 100m.Team Boys: Simbarashe Maketa (medley relay), Donavan Mutariswa (200m), Alfred Chawonza (800m), Tapiwa Makarau (200m)Girls: Vimbai Maisvoreva (800m), Arage Mutombo (800), Mascline Watama (medley relay).
