Tonderai NdirayaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FC Platinum s 18-match unbeaten run in the Castle Lager Premiership, dating back to last season, came to an end at the weekend when they fell 1-2 to Ngezi Platinum Stars. The Zvishavane side had last lost a league match on October 8 when they went down 1-2 to Harare City.FC Platinum picked themselves up from that City defeat to record an incredible 18 match unbeaten run. That run comprised nine wins and nine draws.FC Platinum had gone on an unbeaten run of 14 matches this season, consisting of six wins and eight draws.Goals either side of the halftime by Donald Teguru and 18-year-old Tatenda Mchisa handed Ngezi maximum points, while Brett Amidu rose from the bench to score the visitors consolation.Ngezi broke a four-game winless run and claimed back top position from Harare giants Dynamos, who had occupied it for less than 24 hours following their 2-0 win over Bantu Rovers on Friday night.Ngezi s last win had been on May 28 when they beat Bulawayo City 3-2 at home.The weekend victory over FC Platinum took Ngezi to 31 points from 16 games and lead Dynamos by two points.Ngezi s win left coach Tonderai Ndiraya believing that his team can cause major upsets in their quest to lift the championship. We have assembled a very good team and I think this team will win more games in the future and take this team forward, Ndiraya said.FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza felt his side conceded soft goals. If you look at the first goal, the goalkeeper (Petros Mhari) was supposed to come out for the ball, and then the second one came from the blind side.However, I do think that it was a good game of football, but in terms of our standards we did not really do well, Mapeza said.To keep up with the championship chasing teams, FC Platinum, who are in sixth position with 26 points, need to bounce back to winning ways in their next game against Chapungu.The Zvishavane side, which missed a glut of scoring opportunities at Ngezi, might throw into the fray striker Takesure Chinyama, who joined them last week from Poland.Meanwhile, Dynamos continued with their steady rise and are now second following their victory over struggling Bantu Rovers.DeMbare moved two places up the ladder, leapfrogging Chicken Inn, who suffered a shock 0-2 loss to Chapungu, as well as Black Rhinos, who shared spoils with ZPC Kariba following a 1-1 draw.Tsholotsho FC blew a perfect opportunity to register their first win of the season by surrendering a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with Triangle United in Beitbridge.Hwange held Harare City 1-1, while Shabanie Mine beat How Mine 1-0.Results Friday: Dynamos 2-0 Bantu Rovers Saturday: Tsholotsho FC 2-2 Triangle United, Ngezi Platinum 2-1 FC Platinum, Chapungu 2-0 Chicken Inn, ZPC Kariba 1-1 Black Rhinos Sunday: Highlanders 1-0 Yadah FC, Shabanie Mine 1-0 How Mine, Harare City 1-1 Hwange, Bulawayo City v Caps United (postponed)Table P W D L F A GD Pts Ngezi Platinum 16 9 4 3 25 14 11 31 *Dynamos 14 9 2 3 22 12 10 29 Black Rhinos 15 8 4 3 18 7 11 28 Chicken Inn 15 9 1 5 15 7 8 28 Highlanders 16 8 4 4 17 13 4 28 FC Platinum 15 6 8 1 13 7 6 26 How Mine 15 7 4 4 11 10 1 25 ZPC Kariba 16 7 3 6 18 16 2 24 *Chapungu 15 5 6 4 10 10 0 21 Triangle United 16 4 7 5 14 17 -3 19 Harare City 16 4 6 6 9 9 0 18 Shabanie Mine 16 4 6 6 11 14 -3 18 Bulawayo City 15 5 2 8 16 20 -4 17 Yadah FC 16 4 4 8 14 20 -6 16 Hwange 15 3 5 7 10 19 -9 14 Caps United 9 3 4 2 14 9 5 13 Bantu Rovers 16 2 2 12 18 37 -19 8 Tsholotsho FC 16 0 6 10 8 22 -14 6 *match abandoned @ZililoR
