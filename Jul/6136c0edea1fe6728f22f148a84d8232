Ngqwele Dube, Sports Correspondent HIGHLANDERS Darts Club has set its sights on clinching the Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Darts League title after taking a slender lead in the championship race. Bosso are unbeaten in 10 games and after a two-week break, the side is hoping to come back strong and continue their winning ways.The club is hoping to emulate last year s winners Archers by ending the season without a loss.The league resumes today for the second half and Bosso start off with a tough encounter against fourth-placed Parkview Lions.Bosso captain Julius Ncube said after an impressive first half, they are ready to continue with their winning streak.He said the unbeaten run has given them confidence, but admitted any defeat could see them plunge and dent their confidence. I think what s important is that we avoid defeat at any cost and that means winning every game. We certainly respect our opponents, but at the same time we know we have to take our game to a higher level because everyone will want to win against us because of the unbeaten run. We are aware we are the team to beat, hence we will have to up our play in each and every game. There won t be time to relax, said Ncube, who is also secretary of the Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Darts Association.He said their opening fixture in the second round against Lions is a tricky tie, which they, however, have to win to set the tone for a good season.Ncube said regular practice has worked in their favour together with a wide pool of 15 players they can draw from for their games.Defending champions Archers are second with eight points, the same as former champions and perennial title challengers Railstars.Today Railstars take on bottom placed Bellevue, while Archers square off against Queens.Ncube said with four teams folding last year, the league was more competitive this year. We had 15 teams last year, but we are now left with 11 after four failed to register. This resulted in players moving to other teams, creating more competition. I think the league is more competitive than it was last year with more difficult games, he said.Railstars Patrick Zimidzi has won the most games with 49 and is followed by Bosso s Mgcini Nkala, who has won two less games, and Railstars Eucled Chahuma and Bosso s Albert Tawanda with 46 wins.Chirwa and Zimidzi are level in the number of 180s at five each, while Archers Tafadzwa Mtomba and Lions Dennis Nkomo sit on four apiece and McClyn Chirwa of Highlanders has scored three 180s so far.Tawanda leads in the 6 packs, a term which is used to denote when a player beats all the six players in the opponents team during a single match, with a haul of five.Johannes Chirwa, Zimidzi, Nkosiyabensundu Mthombeni and Bonface Maningi all have garnered three 6 packs.Fixtures Wednesday: Archers v Queens, Parkview Khanka v Khami, Parkview Lions v Bosso, Railstars v Bellevue, Support Unit Fairbridge v Zimbabwe School of Mines, How Mine is on a bye.
