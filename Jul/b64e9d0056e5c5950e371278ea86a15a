Professor Eddie MwenjeWalter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent INDUSTRY, Education and Government should collaborate in developing innovative solutions to industrial challenges. Addressing captains of industry, university and polytechnics officials during a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workshop in Masvingo, Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) Vice Chancellor, Professor Eddie Mwenje, said increased synergy between Government, universities and industries was critical for a robust industrialisation.He said the reason why Zimbabwe was not faring well on the global innovation index is that the three partners were not working together. It is imperative for industry, Government and universities or polytechnics to work together during research. Many researches done by academics at universities have not been exposed to industry and that is not healthy. Industry, Government and Education should collaborate, said Prof Mwenje.He said a number of university graduates were now selling airtime on the streets because the training has not equipped them for the right purpose. Some of our graduates are selling airtime instead of being productive in industries.Universities should work with industry so that they produce graduates with the required skills, said Prof Mwenje.Zimbabwe is on position 121 out of 127 on global innovation index despite having a 92 percent literacy level in Africa. Prof Mwenje said research work at a number of local universities is not shared with the industry hence the country is not doing well in the area of innovation.He said it was time Government, industry and higher learning institutions work together to make the STEM dream a reality.On the need for key centres of excellency at universities, Prof Mwenje said: All universities should have a school of medicine, school of technology and school of agricultural engineering. I am aware that all State universities have mandates but things have changed. The Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development is moving around the country holding meetings with industries and universities conscientising them on how they can participate in the STEM programme. @walterbmswazie3
