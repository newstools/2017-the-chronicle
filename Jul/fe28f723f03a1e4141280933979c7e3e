AFPRaymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent A solitary goal by Zifa Southern Region Division One debutantes Zim Leopards saw them dismissing hosts Casmyn in a match played at Turk Mine on Saturday. Benboy Chinyanga ghosted in from the blind side to slot in the goal that made the difference between the two teams in the 53rd minute.Casmyn, who are coached by former Highlanders defender Dazzy Kapenya, were favourites going into the match.Kapenya pointed out that his charges were complacent from the start of the match. Casmyn has been in Division One for a couple of years now and I think the biggest mistake we made was taking our opponents for granted and paid dearly for that, said Kapenya after the game.Tambudzai Ngulube could have put Zim Leopards into the lead in 42nd minute but failed to beat Casmyn keeper Zibusiso Ndlovu.Casmyn could have equalised in the 58th minute through what would have been a lucky goal when defender Webster Kondowe made a speculative cross into the Zim Leopards box and the ball crashed onto the woodwork, with the visitors goal minder Desire Phiri seemingly beaten.Casmyn probably felt that it was not their day in the 71st minute when Charles Mususha s shot was tipped over the bar by Phiri.Meanwhile, the Nokel Security Top Goal Scorer for May Malvin Dube was handed his $200 prize money at half time.The Zim Leopards striker scored an impressive five goals in May and was handed his cash by Nokel Security director Kenneth Mhlophe. @RaymondJaravaza
