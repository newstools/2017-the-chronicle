Sunday ChidzambwaSikhumbuzo Moyo in Sun City, South Africa WARRIORS Cosafa Castle Cup coach Sunday Chidzambwa has declared his intentions of leading the four-time regional champions to a record fifth title on June 9. The Warriors are on course to lift the cup after storming into the semi-finals following a 2-1 win over Swaziland on Sunday night, with goals coming from co-skipper Ovidy Karuru and super sub Knox Mutizwa.Karuru shot Zimbabwe into the lead in the 17th minute to take his goal tally to six, but Sihlangu hit back moments after the breather through dangerman Felix Badenhorst, who capitalised on poor marking by the Zimbabwe central defence of Liberty Chakoroma and Jimmy Tigere.Swaziland dominated the exchanges in the second half, but could not find the breakthrough, although they looked deadly each time they ventured upfront until the Zimbabwe bench brought on Mutizwa for young Prince Dube, who had a rather quiet game despite coming close twice.Mutizwa repaid the faith shown in him by the bench, with a cheeky header in the 78th minute off an equally cheeky corner kick delivered by co-captain Ocean Mushure to restore Zimbabwe s lead and into the semi-finals.Chidzambwa says the focus, just like other teams left in the tournament, is to go all the way to the final and possibly lift the cup. Any coach in this tournament would like to get to the final and I am one of them. I mean if you ask any team which is in the semi-final, they will tell you that they want to be in the final and possibly win the trophy, but it s only one that will win the trophy and, that s football, said Chidzambwa.He, however, remained cautious and was not carried away by facing Lesotho, who have yet to register a win over Zimbabwe in six Cosafa Cup encounters.The Warriors have won five wins and drawn once in Harare in 2009. In the five wins Zimbabwe managed, there were three own goals by Lesotho.To book a place in tomorrow s semi-final, Lesotho knocked out 2015 champions Namibia 5-4 penalties after a nil-all stalemate. I did watch Lesotho, they are in the semi-finals and on Wednesday we are going to meet 11 guys from Lesotho and the team that scores more goals will advance to the final, Chidzambwa said.&nbsp;
