Last week, the tourism authority offered recently crowned Miss Mt Pleasant Constituency (Harare) Sikhulile Shumba and her two princesses Floreet Chikomwe and Vimbayi Mungofa a four-day holiday in Victoria Falls as one of their prizes for winning. By doing this, the ZTA wanted the models to have a feel of the country s prime resort and help market it.During their visit, the models &#8211; who arrived in Victoria Falls on Friday and flew back to Harare on Sunday &#8211; partook in activities such as gorge swing, bungee jumping, rafting and a game drive.The Chronicle caught up with the three models who pledged to partner ZTA in marketing the country s tourist attractions.The queen, a 3rd year Sociology student at the University of Zimbabwe thanked ZTA for exposing them to the other side of Zimbabwe. This was my first time in Victoria Falls and it s amazing. I want to thank ZTA for this opportunity and I promise to work hard to make sure this destination and all activities on offer are known locally and internationally, Shumba said.First princess, Chikomwe said the world s 7th natural wonder is a must visit for everyone while Mungofa, an A Level student at Pace College in Harare was on cloud nine, promising to spread the gospel of domestic tourism so locals do not learn about the country s resorts from foreigners. I ll make sure all youths I interact with know about Victoria Falls than to be told by foreign tourists, Mungofa said.ZTA spokesperson Sugar Chagonda said they had given the models the package as a way to promote domestic tourism. As ZTA, our mandate is to market our destinations and when we get an opportunity we seize it. We pledged to send the winners to Victoria Falls because we want these models to appreciate and market our unique destinations when they interact with their colleagues locally and internationally, said Chagonda.@ncubeleon
