Dr Lazarus DokoraOliver Kazunga, Senior Reporter THE Government needs an estimated $18,5 million to fund the schools feeding programme up to the end of next term, Primary and Secondary Education Minister Dr Lazarus Dokora has said. The schools feeding initiative was introduced by Government in May last year following a poor harvest but the Government has said the feeding programme is now a permanent feature in schools to enable pupils from poor families to concentrate on their education.Responding to questions in Parliament last week, Dr Dokora said in collaboration with other Government ministries, they had scaled-up the programme to cover all primary school pupils. The calculation of the component of grain requirement to the end of next term in December is about $18.5 million. Communites are expected to complement Government by providing relish for the feeding programme, he said.Dr Dokora said both urban and rural primary schools were covered by the programme. When we began schools feeding at the infant level last year, the urban sector was excluded except where there was confirmed hardships. For instance, in the areas in Harare, I can cite the areas in Epworth. Those were identified under the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (Zimvac) as requiring this kind of measure, he said.Dr Dokora said starting from May next year, Government expects to introduce the feeding scheme at day secondary schools.@okazunga
