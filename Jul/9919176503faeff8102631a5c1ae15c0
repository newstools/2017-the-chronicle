Tendai ChirauShowbiz Reporter THE Miss World Zimbabwe contestants who have made it to the finals will be unveiled tonight at a Sashing ceremony taking place at the Miss Zimbabwe Trust offices in Harare. The 16 shortlisted models who have been in boot camp for the past week will spend their last week undergoing rigorous catwalk training, visiting charity institutions and national monuments in preparation for the final day.Six models who were also in camp but were evicted, failed to make it for the finals taking place next week Saturday at the Borrowdale Brooke Golf Course. Models from the diaspora who had been billed to participate in the pageant will also no longer be part of the event after they faced logistical challenges. The models from the diaspora could not make it to Zimbabwe due to issues beyond our control so they ll no longer be participating this year, said Miss Zimbabwe Trust spokesperson, Tendai Chirau.However, Chirau said they were content with the quality of models they had attracted saying all was set for the Sashing ceremony. We re happy with the quality of models and we re confident that we ll crown a Queen who ll represent the country well at Miss World and other national duties. We ll be sashing the models on Friday and also unveiling them to the public, he said.Like previous editions, invites to the Miss World Zimbabwe pageant have been pegged at $300 as the Trust seeks to make the event a world class one.

Those interested in attending the finale can buy invites for $300 or a corporate table for $3 000 at the Miss Zimbabwe Trust offices in Harare. Chirau said preparations for the Miss World Zimbabwe finale were going on well adding that they were still finalising on artistes who will entertain people at the finale.The finale will be broadcast live on ZBCtv as from 8:30 PM next Saturday with the lady who will be crowned queen earning herself a spot at the Miss World finale among other prizes which are yet to be revealed.
