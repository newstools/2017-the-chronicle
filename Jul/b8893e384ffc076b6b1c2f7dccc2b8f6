Blessings Chidakwa /Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporters A MAN from Gweru collapsed and died after downing a 750 ml bottle of Two Keys whisky while celebrating his 21st birthday. Midlands Provincial Magistrate Ms Pathekile Msipa waived post mortem as foul play was not suspected in Peason Sibanda s death which happened on Friday.According to a post mortem report, Sibanda died due to alcohol poisoning.Sibanda s family could not be reached immediately, but a neighbour Mr Fungayi Moyana said Sibanda &#8211; who was celebrating his 21st birthday &#8211; was trying to impress his friends by having one too many.He said trouble started when Sibanda made a bet with his friends to gulp down a 750 ml bottle of Two Keys whisky.Mr Moyana said later that day, Sibanda collapsed and died at Matinunura High School in Gweru where he was running a tuck shop at the school premises. I saw Sibanda early in the morning with his buddies on a beer drinking spree and they were stone drunk. Sibanda is said to have made a bet with his friends that he would finish a whole bottle of Two Keys whisky but it got too heavy for him and he ended up proving to a be lightweight for the toxic spirit, said Mr Moyana. I was later shocked to receive news that Sibanda collapsed at Matinunura and died. I strongly suspect that it was the heavy drinking that led to his death. Sibanda was buried yesterday at Mkoba Village 9 Cemetery in Gweru.Midlands Police Spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende could not be reached for a comment over the matter. @HonBlessings @amanda49
