Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent THE interim committee that has been running Highlanders Royals since its revival last year has been dissolved due to infighting. The Royals were revived in 2016 to compete in the Southern Region Women s League after years on the sidelines of the women s game.Nhlanhla Dube, Highlanders chief executive officer, said the decision to disband the interim committee was reached after noting that infighting was impacting negatively on the operations of the team. The interim committee has been dissolved, not because they have been failing to run the team, but due to infighting amongst the executive members. We will appoint a coordinator, who will be the link between the Royals and Highlanders Football Club. The coordinator will be announced very soon, said Dube.The interim committee had been divided over a proposal by some members to join the Premier League, while others argued that Royals were not ready to join the elite league.Members opposed to joining the Premier League argued that the team is still rebuilding and cannot compete with bigger clubs, such as Rhinos Queens, Chipembere and Inline Academy at national level.The majority of Highlanders Royals players are schoolgirls.Playing in the Premier League also comes with a financial burden of accommodation when playing away in Harare and other cities.When the Royals were revived last year, the parent club Highlanders FC made it clear that the women s football team should not expect financial assistance.Local businessman Kenneth Mhlophe has been assisting the Royals with transport allowances for the players, among other needs. @RaymondJaravaza.
