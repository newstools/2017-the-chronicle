Rahman GumboRicky Zililo,Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Shabanie Mine attacking midfielder Collins Duhwa could be a surprise trump card for Chicken Inn when they face Dynamos in a potential Castle Lager Premier Soccer League thriller at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow. Duhwa, who denied Dynamos maximum points with a 44th minute equaliser in Shabanie s 1-1 draw against the former champions in Harare on May 22, finalised his move to the Bulawayo side on Thursday.Tawengwa Hara, Chicken Inn s secretary-general, confirmed the signing of Duhwa and said the player could make his debut if they got his licence from the PSL. Duhwa is now a Chicken Inn player and as it is, we re sorting out his licence. If everything goes well, he might play against Dynamos in the event that the coach (Rahman Gumbo) sees it proper, said Hara.Duhwa fills the slot left by box-to-box midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu, who joined Tanzania Premiership side Singida United.Chicken Inn are also chasing after the signature of TP Mazembe midfielder Ali Sadiki.The 2015 league champions will promote a player from their development side to replace national team defender Teenage Hadebe, who is now with South African giants Kaizer Chiefs.Duhwa s arrival gives Gumbo lots of options in midfield for the crunch tie against Dynamos.The Gamecocks are without Innocent Mucheneka, who is with the Warriors at the Cosafa Castle Cup in South Africa and this could open the door for Duhwa to play in front of defensive midfielder Thabani Goredema. He can also play as a winger.Chicken Inn also welcome back striker Daryl Nyandoro, who missed their shock 0-2 loss to Chapungu through suspension.A compact and creative midfield is what Chicken Inn will need to get the better of Dynamos, who are dangerous offensively where they are led by Christian Epoupa, Emmanuel Mandiranga and Denver Mukamba.Chicken Inn are likely to have the quartet of Passmore Bernard, Guide Goddard, Moses Jackson and Divine Lunga providing cover for goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze.Marshal Machazane, Lincoln Zvasiya, Obey Mwerahari and Peace Makaha will form DeMbare s rearguard, with Tichaona Chipunza and Takunda Sadiki operating in midfield.Dynamos manager Richard Chihoro is hoping to ride on their recent form that has seen them winning six consecutive matches to overcome Chicken Inn.Chihoro said they had little respect for Chicken Inn, who beat them home and away last season. Chicken Inn won 3-0 at Barbourfields and 3-2 in Harare. Barbourfields is our second home; we always do well at Barbourfields and we re coming there to do well. We know Chicken Inn have been playing well and they can challenge for the championship, but we re banking on our form to carry us through. We can t afford to respect a team simply because they beat us home and away last season, said Chihoro.Meanwhile, log leaders Ngezi take their act to Triangle United knowing that a defeat to the Lowveld side might cost them top spot.Ngezi are bubbling with confidence following last weekend s 2-1 home win over FC Platinum.Triangle survived an away scare, coming from 2-0 to force a 2-2 draw against Tsholotsho FC.In their last home game, Triangle edged ZPC Kariba 1-0.A double header is on the cards at Luveve Stadium this afternoon with Bulawayo City and Bantu Rovers locking horns in an early kick-off before How Mine play host to Harare City.FixturesToday: Bantu Rovers v Bulawayo City (Luveve, 1PM), How Mine v Harare City (Luveve, 3PM), FC Platinum v Chapungu (Mandava), Yadah v Shabanie Mine (Morris Depot)Tomorrow: Triangle United v Ngezi Platinum (Gibbo), Chicken Inn v Dynamos (Barbourfields), Hwange v ZPC Hwange (Colliery), Black Rhinos v Tsholotsho FC (Morris Depot), Caps United v Highlanders (postponed)
