Mr Busisa MoyoUNITED Refineries managing director, Mr Busisa Moyo, is the new president of Oil Expressers Association of Zimbabwe (OEA) with effect from June 12, 2017. He replaces, Mr Sylvester Mangani. In a statement to members the Oil Expressers Association of Zimbabwe said the elections for a new president were overdue. Mr Mangani is the managing director for Surface Wilmar. The Oil Expressers Association of Zimbabwe convened the elections for its Office bearers on June 12, 2017. The elections were overdue as the existing chairman and secretary were holding office for an extended period of two years and five months since assuming office in 2014-15. The normal tenure of the OEA office bearers is two years, said the oil expressers. The number of members had since grown in the OEA from three to seven following the creation of fresh capacity in the post Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016 which has resulted in the growth of the domestic oil extraction and refining industry, said the association. Sanjiv Mathur of Pure Oil Industries is the new secretary and is taking over from Mr Moyo. The association is indebted to the diligent work done by the outgoing team that was led by Mr Mangani which saw the association being recognised as an effective industry body that represents the common view and approach on all important issues related to the industry. In the same vein, the association wishes all the success to the new leadership and the members are looking forward to the association representing and articulating matters for the benefit of all, said the association.
