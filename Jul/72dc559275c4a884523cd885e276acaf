Matabeleland North Provincial Administrator Ms Latiso Dlamini told officials attending a Civil Protection Unit (CPU) disaster and needs assessment workshop in Bulawayo recently that the major challenge in distributing aid was dishonesty and lack of accountability by those handling donations. Pilferage by police officers and nurses was a challenge that marred the distribution of food, clothing and other donations to flood victims. Some of the nurses and police officers were caught red-handed stealing food and other items meant for flood victims, she said.The PA said such acts tarnished the image of the police and civil servants as well as discourage donors from assisting the needy. It is very embarrassing to learn than those entrusted to distribute donations have turned thieves, said Ms Dlamini.She said more than 500 000 households in the province were affected by floods this last rainy season.Meanwhile, a report from Ms Dlamini s office indicated that many households affected by floods in the province are still in need of assistance.According to the report, 1 915 households were left homeless while 317 were permanently displaced.A total of 12 740 families in Nkayi district lost almost 5 000 hectares of grain.The report shows that seven health institutions were damaged and the worst affected was Binga district.Ten bridges were destroyed, 25 roads were left non-navigable and four dip tanks left unusable.Responding to the report, CPU Deputy Director Mrs Sibusisiwe Ndlovu said: These are worrying figures considering that we are talking of just one province. I wonder what figure we will get when we consolidate data from all our 10 provinces. Mrs Ndlovu said the issue of damaged toilets had to be dealt with as a matter of urgency to avoid possible diseases outbreak. @andile_tshuma
