Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) has increased the number of teams set to compete in the National Rugby League (NRL) from eight to 10 in a bid to have more rugby being played. ZRU is working on reviving the NRL, which prematurely ended in 2014.The union was forced to suspend the NRL with six rounds of games left in 2014 after clubs failed to secure financial resources to fulfil away matches following the withdrawal of main sponsors Delta Beverages.ZRU vice-president Noddy Kanyangarara, who was the NRL chairman when the clubs competition came to an abrupt end, said the topflight league would resume next month. The wheels of reviving the NRL are in motion and what we ve done is come up with a provisional fixture. Our target was to start our games on March 25, but we now have to move that date by a week or two as some of the clubs have made commitments to tour Zambia. This time around the NRL will have 10 teams, meaning that we re going to have an exciting season and where our teams will play more rugby, Kanyangarara said.Old Hararians, Harare Sports Club, Old Georgians, Matabeleland Warriors, Old Miltonians, Western Panthers, Mutare, Police Defenders, Old Johannes and Bulldogs will compete in the expanded NRL.Kanyangarara said the return of the NRL would enhance competition among clubs and also produce quality players for national teams.He said they are still looking for partners to help offset part of their budget. Our priority is to look for partners to take care of transportation of teams. Moving teams for games is our biggest cost, but we re hopeful of securing corporate support because we ve been talking to a number of companies, including our previous sponsor Delta Beverages, Kanyangarara said.@ZililoR
