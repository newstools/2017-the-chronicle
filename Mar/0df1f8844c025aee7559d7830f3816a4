Tendai ChikuniLovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU coach Tendai Chikuni says he is happy with the depth in his squad for the 2017 season. Chapungu retained some players they had loaned out to sister clubs, among them striker Brighton Mugoni, who was with Blue Swallows last season.Zifa Central Soccer League soccer star of the year Ricky Bota, Livingstone Genti, Lloyd Gwerina, Blessing Sahondo, Kelvin Bingala and Nigel Papius are some of the new faces in the Chapungu dressing room that were recruited from other clubs.It is this mixture of new signings and the old guard that Chikuni believes will ensure his side makes an impact this season. I am happy that we have managed to build combinations that are paying off well and with the players that we have, there is a lot of competition in the team. Everyone wants to play, which has seen players wanting to prove themselves, said Chikuni. I have six strikers so it s not going to be easy, but a positive headache for me. With the depth that we have in the side, there is no reason why we should not be able to offer strong competition in the forthcoming season. He said his philosophy would be to keep possession and play a passing game.At his unveiling in January, the former Shabanie Mine and FC Platinum coach expressed his desire to finish in the top eight and also win trophies at the club.The top eight finish has eluded the Gweru-based side since their return to the Premiership in 2004. The closest they came to achieving a top eight finish was in 2015 when the finished ninth.Chapungu s trophy cabinet has been empty, with their last cup triumph being in 1995 when they won the Castle Cup, which earned them a ticket to play in the then Caf Cup Winners Cup.
