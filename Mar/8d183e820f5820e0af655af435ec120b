Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter AILING Bulawayo companies will process more than 100 000 tonnes of cotton that the country is likely to harvest this season. Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Chiratidzo Mabuwa told Parliamentarians the move to process the cotton in Bulawayo was meant to rejuvenate the textile industries.She said the resuscitation of Bulawayo industries was important as spelt out by the Special Economic Zones law.Deputy Minister Mabuwa said the national Cotton to Clothing Policy was launched in Bulawayo to emphasise the drive to improve the textile industry, particularly in Bulawayo. Looking at that, we assume that we will harvest a lot of cotton this season. Hon Made will probably give you the tonnage but we are expecting about 100 000 metric tonnes of cotton, she said.The deputy minister said Bulawayo should have a place where this cotton should be processed from lint right through the value chain up to clothing. The textile industry in Bulawayo has since been resuscitated and they are supplying Edgars with clothes manufactured in Bulawayo. I would like this House to know that there is no reason to import suits and shirts for men because we have them in Bulawayo, said Deputy Minister Mabuwa.She said the city would also benefit from a policy to revamp the leather industry. In the leather industry, we are looking forward to resuscitate the industry through the Cold Storage Company because that will resuscitate the leather industry in Bulawayo. We are also looking at the heavy industries in Bulawayo that supply mines throughout the country, the deputy Minister said.She said the government would have a Bulawayo showcase programme just before this year s International Trade Fair to market what is happening in the city.A majority of Bulawayo industries have shut down over the years, reducing the city from its one time lofty status of being the country s manufacturing hub. @thamamoe
