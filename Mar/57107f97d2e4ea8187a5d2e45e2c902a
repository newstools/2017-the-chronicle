She was running to her aunt s place but unfortunately her aunt did not open the door for her leading to her sleeping in the toilet at a neighbouring house, said Asst Insp Ncube.He said investigations on the matter were still in progress although no one has been arrested.Moyo s body was allegedly found with fractured hands, with a deep cut on the neck, and several head injuries.@nqotshili
