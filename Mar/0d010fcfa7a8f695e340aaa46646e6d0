Russell Mhiribidi, Sliz directorRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter GREAT Zimbabwe will host the inaugural Higher and Tertiary Education Autumn Sports Management Camp in May organised by the Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe (Sliz). The camp is targeting tertiary and higher education institutions decision makers, that is principals, vice-principals, deans of students and heads of sports departments for the camp that runs from May 26-28.Russell Mhiribidi, Sliz director, told Chronicle Sport yesterday that the camp would deal with the new education curricula, which includes sport as an examinable subject, as well as enhancing the teaching of mass displays. Wellness and active lifestyle is what the Government is encouraging and as Sliz we ve seen it proper to organise a workshop for higher and tertiary education institutions so that we address a number of issues. Remember, the teachers who teach pupils physical education and sport come from these institutions, so it s prudent that we interact with them on matters to do with sports management issues, said Mhiribidi.He said they would also highlight the importance of setting up vibrant university sporting leagues. We re of the view that universities are the zenith of sports development and as such there is a need to have vibrant leagues for different sporting disciplines. Universities and tertiary education institutions have some of the best sporting facilities for use in league programmes instead of just having festivals. It is also possible for these institutions to get sound sponsorships from strategic partners just like what happens across the Limpopo where South Africa has vibrant university leagues, said Mhiribidi.He said his organisation, which also runs winter and summer camps for sports administrators, was also working on inviting agricultural colleges to their Great Zimbabwe camp.Mhiribidi said they had courted officials from the African Sports Management Association (ASMA) to grace the Higher and Tertiary Education Autumn Sports Management Camp.
