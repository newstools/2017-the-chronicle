Clubs must use this competition to gear up for the season which starts next month. Registration of clubs and players for the 2017 season is still open and the deadline is March 30. This year we might see other teams joining the league so that means more competitive matches, said Banda.Last year, the league had 10 clubs under its umbrella and these are: Fox, Khalanyoni, FC Amabhubesi, Fog, Nyoro United, Rome, Wangu Wangu, Binga United, Cowdray Park and Nust.Five-A-Side football, also known as futsal, is played on a smaller field and mainly indoors. It is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper and unlimited substitutions are permitted.The game is played with a smaller ball with less bounce than a regular football due to the surface of the field. The surface, ball and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. @khumzallen
