There is a man who died in my area while he was on his way to Hingwe Clinic. He was attacked by his cousin brother while they were at a village in Botswana which is close to the border line. The two men were working in the neighbouring country as field workers and they were illegal immigrants. After the attack their employer ferried them to the border and left them there to find their way to a nearby clinic, he said.Chief Madlambuzi said Mhlanga and Moyo were allegedly drinking beer at a bottle store in the neighbouring country on Wednesday at around 9PM when Mhlanga asked his cousin to lend him P10 as he wanted to buy more beer.He said Mhlanga promised to pay the money within a week but Moyo refused to give him. He said a misunderstanding arose between the two relatives and Mhlanga struck his cousin with a hoe several times on the head. Mhlanga was carrying a hoe that he had brought from his workplace and he struck his cousin brother on the head. Moyo fell to the ground and bled profusely. Other patrons rushed to inform Moyo s employer of what had happened. Mhlanga and two men who were also at the bar used an illegal entry point along the Botswana-Zimbabwe border line to ferry Moyo to a local clinic, said Chief Madlambuzi.He said Moyo died while on his way to the clinic. The chief said the issue was reported to the police who immediately arrested Mhlanga while Moyo s body was taken to Plumtree District Hospital Mortuary.Chief Madlambuzi said it was worrying that a life was lost over such a petty issue. @DubeMatutu
