Lovemore Zigara in Gweru AMBITIOUS Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) side Nichrut intensify their season preparations when they take on Premiership side ZPC Kariba at Peak Mine Stadium tomorrow. Nichrut coach John Nyikadzino said they will use the friendly match to gauge the players’ level of preparedness ahead of the CSL season which is set to kick off next month. “We are going to use the ZPC Kariba game to gauge our level of preparedness ahead of the new season. We have been working hard so that we achieve our objective of the season which is to end the year in the top four,” Nyikadzino said. The Shurugwi-based outfit played to a 2-2 draw against Dynamos in February. Nichrut promises to be the team to beat this season in the CSL after the club president Nicholas Gara gave Nyikadzino an open cheque to sign players of his choice. Nyikadzino has obliged by bringing an array of players who have Premiership experience, which makes them pre-season favourites. Some of the players who have trekked to the Shurugwi outfit  include the former Hwange duo of Farai Vimisai and David Boriwondo, Agrippa Peperere and Simon Maengeni who did duty with Chapungu last season, former Dynamos and Tripple B forward Aleck Marime and Farai Mususunye who was with Border Strikers last season. Former Caps United left back Asani Nhongo, Vimbai Madamombe and Khamalongosh Chidzero who were with Whawha in 2015 as well as ex-FC Platinum and MSU midfielder Bastos Chihowa  are also at Nichrut. — @lavuzigara1
