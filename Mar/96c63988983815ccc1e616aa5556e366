Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter THE Kwekwe City Council is seeking public private partnerships (PPPs) to rescuscitate a local brewery unit and an abattoir after admitting that it has failed to run the two entities. Mayor Councillor Matenda Madzoke said due to the difficult economic conditions and limited financial resources, the local authority has failed to run the brewery and the abattoir. He said those interested in running the entities would be given five-year leases subject to renewal. “As the local authority we have failed to run the Kwekwe-Simba Brewery and the abattoir. Council is keen to implement a project envisaging design, build, finance, renovation, operation and maintenance of its abattoir with private sector participation,” said Cllr Madzoke. He said coupled with a salary backlog and the demand by workers for salary increments, council was already in the red and struggling to meet its obligations. “So we have come to an agreement with our employees to lease the brewery and abattoir to private partners,” Cllr Madzoke said  adding that interested partners must submit proposed rentals for the facility and bidders with the highest proposed rentals will stand a better chance to succeed. He said council was going to make money from rentals. — @amanda49.
