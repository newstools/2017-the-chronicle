Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Cross Border Traders Association of Zimbabwe has called for Government intervention in addressing challenges affecting traders at the country s ports of entry. CBTA president, Dr Killer Zivhu, made the call during the launch of a $15 million funding facility for traders in Beitbridge this week. The funding package will be released to re-capitalise hundreds of cross border traders in the country. Dr Zivhu said the fund was being channelled through the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe subsidiary, Home-Link. We are negotiating with Government and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority to look into the trading barriers at our borders. People are spending long hours waiting to clear goods at the borders and this is discouraging trade. We are equally concerned with the harassment of our members at the ports of entry and on major highways by law enforcement agents, said Dr Zivhu. You will note that every effort we make in capacitating our members will come to naught if our borders are not made user friendly. It is important that we improve the ease of doing business .Dr Zivhu said they were working on modalities to ensure that most cross border traders are licensed to import goods and items that will improve productivity locally.He added that they were also engaging Government to ensure that access to foreign currency by their members was improved.Dr Zivhu said they were also helping those who deal with products that are restricted from import under the open general licence were being assisted to get permits to boost their businesses. It s a fact that we have some of our members who are in business involving part of the restricted goods and we are coming in to help them secure the requisite permits , said Dr ZivhuPutin narrowly escaped death after poisoning Putin narrowly escaped death after poisoning Putin narrowly escaped death after poisoning In July last year, the Government removed basic commodities including food items, building material, furniture, toiletries and cooking oil among other things from the Open General Import Licence (OGIL).Under the new list, goods now require a permit prior to importation and travellers are allowed to bring selected goods once per calendar month.&nbsp;
