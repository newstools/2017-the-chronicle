Winners from Imbizo will get a chance to represent the province at Mr and Ms Novice 2017 to be held in Harare on March 25, said Gama.He said today s competition will launch a busy bodybuilding schedule for the city as they will host two major competitions this year. There is a lot of work ahead of us as an association because Bulawayo is going to have more shows this year. We are going to host Mr Iron Man Zimbabwe which will be held in Bulawayo for the first time on June 3. We have managed to get sponsorship for that competition from Clarion Insurance and the following show will be Mr ZITF 2017. This will be the biggest show because it s combined with a lot of events like a Strongman competition, Boot Camp and an Aerobics competition. Mr ZITF 2017 competition is going to be sponsored by PPC. So starting today it s going to be action packed in Bulawayo, he said. @khumzallen
