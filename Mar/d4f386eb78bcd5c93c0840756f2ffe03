Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent GOVERNMENT has ordered the re-opening of a popular beerhall in Chiredzi, Chigarapasi, said to be the country s biggest. Chiredzi Town Council closed the popular beerhall on December 31 last year in compliance with a Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing directive that all non-profit making entities should be closed.The Government has since advised council to resume operations.Chiredzi Town Council chairman Mr Francis Moyo confirmed receiving communication advising council to resume operations. We have received a letter from the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing to that effect. The letter is advising us to re-open Chigarapasi Beerhall and not to lease it to private operators. The beerhall was no longer sustaining itself as it recorded a loss and apart from a government directive to close it, we had come up with contingent plans to save the situation, said Mr Moyo.Chiredzi residents expressed mixed feelings over the closure of the beerhall, home to a number of sex workers in the Lowveld.Married women welcomed the development saying it was going to bring peace into their homes as sex workers would stop preying on their husbands.Prostitutes felt deprived of the opportunity for survival, thus opposed its closure.The community beerhall had become a nerve centre for self-help projects at Tshovani Township where it is located, with unemployed youths and women selling food to patrons while those trading in traditional herbs recorded brisk business. @walterbmswazie3
