DJ Zinhle and her babyPOPULAR DJ, Zinhle Jiyane has spoken out on why she decided to take her daughter Kairo Forbes off social media. Like most moms, DJ Zinhle, AKA s ex wife, is a mom and she is on Instagram. But unlike some moms, Zinhle is a well known public figure and that comes with its own disadvantages.We recently noticed that Zinhle was not posting Kairo s face on Instagram anymore and in an interview she had with Z khiphani, the My name is hit singer explained why. I felt like my child was overexposed so I took her off social media because she is a baby and I thought she just needed time out, said DJ Zinhle.The DJ also shared how a couple once attacked her maid because she did not allow them to take a picture with Kairo as they took a walk. I just thought to myself that if people didn t know how Kairo looked like, maybe the nanny could just take a walk in peace without being pestered. My nanny now has a fear of taking Kairo for a walk and my child needs to be taken for a walk, explained Zinhle.Most celebrity mothers seem not to like posting their children s pictures on social media networks. Locally, Pokello Nare often teases people with not so clear pictures of her son, Tristen. Former Miss Zimbabwe, Vanessa Sibanda only posts pictures of her sons clothes.Media personality Tino Katsande also rarely posts pictures of her miracle baby Yambuko Nokutendaishe.
