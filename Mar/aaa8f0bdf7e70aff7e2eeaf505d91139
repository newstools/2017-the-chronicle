Apparently he strained his knee ligaments and the doctors have been monitoring him since. Chances are very slim that he will be available for the match against FC Platinum, but we have to wait and see in these remaining few days. He is still being assessed by doctors and we are glad it s not a career threatening injury. He has been hopping around under the assessment of doctors and we hope he will get well soon, Ndlovu said.Bosso will be facing FC Platinum in what should be an explosive encounter.
