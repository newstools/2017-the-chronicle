Minister Makhosini HlongwaneNqobile Tshili, Sports Correspondent SPORT and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane has urged former WBC silver welterweight champion Charles Manyuchi to pick himself from last Saturday s defeat and focus on reclaiming his title. Manyuchi was knocked out by Uzbekistan boxer Quadratillo Abduqaxorov in a fight staged in Singapore.He said the Government fully supports Manyuchi despite the loss, adding that losing should be embraced in sport.Hlongwane urged Zimbabweans to desist from proffering conspiracy theories to explain his loss. The Ministry is of the view that Manyuchi s defeat represents an occurrence that is not alien in the world of sport as in any context all sportsmen are expected to either fall in or fall out as they defend their merits, said Hlongwane.However, these circumstantial positions of triumph and defeat must play an interchanging role in the journey of every sportsperson and should not be confused for destiny. Ultimately this unexpected defeat does not conclusively entail what the future holds for Manyuchi. While Manyuchi needs to embrace the outcome of his Singapore experience, our sport fans need to equally embrace the view that athletes are not entitled to unbridled victory. Manyuchi was knocked out in the first round of the match resulting in speculations that his showboating technique cost him the match.The boxer declined to comment about his loss after landing into the country at the beginning of the week.@nqotshili
