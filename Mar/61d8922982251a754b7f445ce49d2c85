England striker Jermain Defoe made a scoring return to the international stage and substitute Jamie Vardy added a second goal as the hosts laboured to a 2-0 victory over Lithuania in World Cup qualifying Group F yesterday. Veteran Defoe, making his first appearance for nearly 3-1/2 years, fired lacklustre England ahead in the 21st minute at Wembley but Gareth Southgate s team struggled to finish off a Lithuania side who are 93 places lower in the Fifa rankings.England survived a couple of worrying moments and had to wait until the 66th minute to double their lead when Defoe s replacement Vardy finished neatly shortly after coming on.It was hardly an emphatic performance but the result kept England top of Group F with 13 points from five games.England s plodding pace allowed Lithuania a relatively comfortable opening 20 minutes on a balmy afternoon.England completely dominated possession but barely tested Ernestas Setkus goal as their passing lacked pace.It took 34-year-old Sunderland striker Defoe to inject some spark, first latching on to Adam Lallana s clever reverse pass to force a fine save from Setkus and then firing England ahead with his 20th goal for his country.Raheem Sterling burst towards the byline and squared the ball for Defoe to plant a shot past Setkus his first England goal since bagging two against San Marino four years ago.The lively Defoe flashed another snap-shot just wide but England toiled away bluntly against Lithuania&#8217;s yellow wall.The hosts had a scare on the stroke of halftime when a clearly offside Nerijus Valskis headed towards an open goal under pressure from goalkeeper Joe Hart but his weak effort was cleared off the line by a retreating John Stones.There was no discernible change of gear at the start of the second half as fans ambled back to their seats.Lithuania had a half-chance when Vykintas Slivka&#8217;s deflected shot was comfortably gathered by captain Hart.England responded with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain&#8217;s 25-metre effort clawed away by a flying Setkus.Defoe then made way for Vardy with Marcus Rashford replacing Sterling and the Leicester City striker made an instant impact, scoring with a neat finish from Lallana&#8217;s pass.
