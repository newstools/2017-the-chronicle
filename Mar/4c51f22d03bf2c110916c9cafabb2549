Ngwabi crossed the line in four minutes 27.33 seconds to join 16 other runners that have already qualified for the semi-finals of the event.The semi-finals will be staged at White City Stadium on the eve of the final set for the ZITF Main Arena on April 29.Bulawayo Athletics Board (BAB) chairperson Manuel Mpofu said the last qualifier for the miler will be held on April 25 at a venue yet to be announced. Only one person qualified for the semi-finals in the Saturday s event. He (Ngwabi) is a good athlete and has the potential of making it to the final. He is not new to this competition and I believe this time he might prove to be a tough competitor. The qualifiers are still on because we are expecting a field of 40 to 60 runners in the semi-finals. From the semi-finals, only 20 will make it to the final, said Mpofu.The Coca-Cola Four-Minute Mile is a male competition with a prerequisite time of four minutes 31 seconds for one to qualify for the finals bankrolled by Delta Beverages.The competition s qualifiers are done throughout the country during NAAZ competitions to give athletes from all corners of the country an opportunity to take part in the final.Semi-final list Phathisa Ngwabi (Hwange Colliery Athletics), Titus Nyathi (Bindura), Thando Maphosa (Sparrows), Caliscious Moyo (LM Academy), Ammon Moyo (Sparrows), Trust Chidomaya (ZRP) Dumo Mkhwananzi (Sparrows), Willard Mutasa (HQ1 Brigade), Nyasha Mutsetse (independent), Levinson Mapfuwa (Black Rhinos), Trust Hove (Black Rhinos), Tendai Zimuto (Black Rhinos), Blessing Whyson (Black Rhinos), Nomore Wikiri (ZPCS), Nyasha Chiuswa (Amen Avademy), Vareri Wellington (Amen Academy), Bornface Jeki (Black Rhinos).@khumzallen
