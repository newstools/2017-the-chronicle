Minister Prisca MupfumiraLeonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE 43rd edition of the African Regional Labour and Administration Centre (ARLAC) officially opened here yesterday with labour experts recommending to ministers of labour to raise awareness against abuse of workers rights. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira, who chairs ARLAC, officially opened the weeklong symposium. She implored African Governments to use labour administration as a tool for development. The concept of labour administration is built on the foundation of creating opportunities for activities that include policy formulation, policy shaping and implementation involving law enforcement, advisory, information services and encouragement of greater self-regulating by social partners. As ministers of labour we need to continue using labour administration as a tool for development and utilise it to change unfair trade rules and ensure that trade agreements are used as instruments for decent work, sustainable development and empowerment of the world s working people, she told delegates. Labour ministers from 11 African countries are attending the governing council and high level symposium on fundamental principles and rights at work, which began on Monday and ends today. International Labour Organisation deputy director Ms Cynthia Olunjowa challenged member states not to make trade deals that harm the poor. She said the continent should start embracing changing world trends in respect of work.Briefing the ministers earlier on recommendations made by experts, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Mr Ngoni Masoka said: There is a need to promote awareness of fundamental principles and rights, deepen understanding of how these principles and rights can be reinforced, advocate for policies that underpin these rights at national level as well as identify challenges in the implementation of these. @ncubeleon
