Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief JOSTLING for the Gweru mayoral post has intensified ahead of elections set for tomorrow following the firing of former mayor Hamutendi Kombayi two weeks ago. Town Clerk Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza told the Chronicle that all councillors participated in an induction course last week in Bulawayo and were set tochoose a new mayor and deputy mayor tomorrow from among themselves. The councillors were in Bulawayo for an induction course. Our intention is to convene our first meeting next week so that they elect a new mayor, his deputy and committee chairpersons, she said.Two weeks ago, the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Cde Saviour Kasukuwere directed that councillors should go for induction before they start any council business.Cde Kasukuwere fired clr Kombayi and clr Kenneth Sithole for alleged gross misconduct, incompetence and mismanagement following recommendations made by an independent tribunal that was headed by a Masvingo lawyer, Mr Isaac Muzenda.Clrs Kombayi and Sithole were part of the 15 councillors who appeared before the independent tribunal facing allegations of gross misconduct, incompetence and mismanagement of council funds and affairs.The dismissal of Clr Kombayi has left the mayoral post vacant while that of deputy mayor fell vacant following the death of deputy mayor Clr Artwell Matyorauta last year.Cde Kasukuwere said due to the previous bad practices within council, councillors had to start conducting their job afresh.The Minister also said council by-elections will be held in wards previously represented by Clrs Kombayi and Sithole.Sources in the ruling party said Clrs Simon Chapukira and Tiripai Chipondeni, both Zanu-PF members are being considered for the mayor s post.The MDC-T is reportedly backing a member of the party Clr Charles Chikozho for the top post. While Zanu-PF has 6 councillors and MDC-T has 10 at Town house, the ruling party is confident that some of the MDC-T councillors will vote for their preferred candidate, said a source at the town house.-@pchitumba1&nbsp;
