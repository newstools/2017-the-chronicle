Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent ZANU-PF s candidate for the Mwenezi East by-election Cde Joosbi Omar yesterday said he has covered enough ground to ensure that he wins the poll set for April 8. His declaration comes in the wake of ZimPF s candidate Mr Kudakwashe Bhasikiti Chuma s withdrawal from the race.The Mwenezi East seat fell vacant following the death last December of Cde Joshua Moyo after a long illness.Cde Omar will now face Mr Welcome Masuku of the National Consultative Assembly (NCA) and Mr Turner Mhango of the Free Zimbabwe Congress party.In an interview yesterday, Cde Omar said he was confident that he would win resoundingly in the by-election. I am confident that I am going to win resoundingly in the forthcoming by-election. We have a total of 54 000 registered voters in Mwenezi East and I look forward to surpass the 50 000 votes mark, said Cde Omar.He said the people of Mwenezi support the ruling party Zanu-PF and have approved his candidature.Cde Omar pledged to improve the people s lives by introducing projects in the drought prone district.He, however, said he was disappointed to learn that Mr Bhasikiti-Chuma, his perceived main challenger decided to pull out of the race as he wanted to demonstrate Zanu-PF s popularity in Mwenezi. I have addressed rallies in 32 wards to date and all gatherings were attended by not less than 1 500 supporters meaning to say we are heading for a landslide victory I am however, disappointed that Bhasikiti-Chuma has developed cold feet and decided to officially pull out of the race. Anyway, he saved himself from humiliation as I was going to beat him all systems out. I would have loved him to stay in the game so that he sees how democratic our party is. I don t feel honoured to run a race with minnows, he said.Cde Omar also said a number of Christian church organisations in Mwenezi support him even though he is Muslim.Efforts to get a comment from Mr Bhasikiti- Chuma were fruitless as his phone rang unanswered the whole day yesterday.He also did not respond to questions sent on his WhatsApp number.Zanu-PF s dominance in Masvingo was reaffirmed in January when its candidate Cde Beauty Chabaya won the Bikita West by-election.She polled more than 13 000 votes against her second placed rival Mr Kudakwashe Gopo of ZimPF who polled 2 400 votes. @walterbmswazie2
