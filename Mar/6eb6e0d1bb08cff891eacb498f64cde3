Mandla MpofuRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City FC has confirmed Mandla Mpofu as the new head coach, taking over from acting gaffer Try Ncube. Mpofu s elevation comes a month after being appointed as an assistant coach on a performance-based contract.City s acting chairman Zenzo Moyo said by appointing Mpofu as head coach the club was complying with a Zifa directive for clubs to employ coaches who are holders of a Caf A licence.Zifa s order also says that the first assistant coach should have a Caf A licence while the second assistant should be a Caf B or Level Four certificate holder.This means that Ncube, a Caf B holder will be the club s second assistant coach. Mandla Mpofu is now the head coach. We re making sure that we comply with the national association s order in terms of standardisation of coaches, said Moyo.Try was in charge of City s last 13 league games, recording five wins, three draws and five defeats as he led the local authority bankrolled side to a top-eight finish.Ncube was thrust into an acting role following the suspension of head coach Philani Beefy Ncube and assistant coach Farai Mujokoro by Zifa for alleged match-fixing. Mujoroko was handed a five-year ban from all football activities while Philani s suspension was lifted last month.At the time of lifting Philani s suspension, acting City chief executive officer MacKenzie Moyo said the club s board had directed termination of the former s contract.Mpofu, the national Under-20 coach and an ex-Railstars, Chicken Inn and Bantu Rovers gaffer, has been working with Try to set a City squad for the 2017 season which should start on April 1. @ZililoR
