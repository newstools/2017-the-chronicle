Losing is not an option for me. I ve worked hard to be regarded as one of the best EFC Africa heavyweight fighters. Beating Mike, especially via a knockout, will enhance my chances of another shot at a title fight and that is what I want. I ll turn Vermeulen into my punching bag. If he holds longer than seven minutes, I ll punch him hard for the rest of the game. I enjoy punching opponents and causing damage, said Moyo.The Bulawayo Bomber lost to Van Zyl in a title fight last October.Moyo has seven career wins from 11 cage fights.It won t be an easy fight for Moyo as Vermuelen also wants to hammer the Bulawayo Bomber and enhance his chances of getting a shot at the title.Vermeulen has vowed to be a nuisance for Moyo. I ve put in lots of time and dedication to the sport. I won t run around or run away from him, I ll get into his face, said Vermeulen. @ZililoR
