We will be leaving the country next week and returning on March 21, said Chipandu.Zimbabwe will play Malaysia in their first match on March 16 and Hong Kong the following day. Coach Ledwin Dondo said preparations have been good. Preparations have been running smoothly and the girls have just passed the physical conditioning. Right now we are focusing on polishing their skills then we are good to go, said Dondo.Dondo said although they are above their opponents in the INF rankings, they will take each game seriously, as each team will be competing to win. We are not going to let those rankings affect our play in any way. The aim is to go there and treat every opponent the same way. We are going there to win, not just to make numbers.
