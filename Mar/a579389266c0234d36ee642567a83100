Joel Tsvakwi, Showbiz Correspondent RISING female gospel music sensation and founder of the Victory Sounds Band, Xolani Mlangeni aka Xoli says artistes need to get out of their comfort zones and stop limiting themselves to their music careers alone. Basking in the glory of her debut album, Wethembekile, Xoli said she is carving a niche for herself in the minds of her fans through philanthropic activities.The versatile Xoli made the remarks recently on the sidelines of an event Live Talk Show which she organised at Qinisani Orphanage and Day Care Centre in Nkulumane s Sekusile suburb.Themed Education is Your Right the event aimed at motivating and give confidence to children housed at the centre. I believe the sky is the limit; wide and accommodating to all sorts of stars of the universe. This motivates me to engage more with the less privileged so as to put smiles on their faces, Xoli said.She said artistes had a role to play in society instead of seeking attention. We re the shining stars of the music industry and arts in general. There s room for all to shine at any given time as long as one understands that he or she is of service to society. Xoli also urged artistes to be united. Artistes need to be united as we pursue our diverse goals. Let s not thrive on jealously and outdoing each other, she said.&nbsp;
