Q DubeKiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter NATIONAL Arts Merit Awards 2016 outstanding comedian winner, Q Dube, has urged fellow comedians to be patient and not rush things as this affects delivery of jokes to the audience. He said comedians should avoid stealing jokes by all means as this kills their brands but instead invest in their craft by starting small, studying and maintaining professionalism in their art. It took me about four years before I reaped the financial rewards of comedy. The most important thing is to really know your craft and be able to grow with each passing show, said Q Dube. Fellow comedians when given a chance should embrace mainstream media because it s always relevant and it reaches a wider scope in terms of coverage.Mainstream media makes one relevant because you ll be talking to an audience of a different age, race, ethnicity and sex. Q Dube said comedy must be turned into a viable business because comedians like Trevor Noah are making a lot money from it adding that the comedy industry in the country should strive to remain profitable despite the economic challenges.Meanwhile, the first lady of Umahlekisa Comedy Club, Lady D, said she would work extra hard and put more effort into her craft. I ll be working on comedy video clips with fellow comedian Clive Chigubhu. I m also looking forward to doing more shows outside Bulawayo and working on a full set with other upcoming and established female comedians, said Lady D. @Kiyaz_Cool&nbsp;
