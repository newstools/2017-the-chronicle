Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Government has started consultations over the establishment of the Teaching Profession Council (TPC), a professional body that will regulate the operations and conduct of teachers in line with the new curriculum. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education started consulting interested parties in the education sector for the creation of the body in Mutare yesterday.There will also be consultations in Masvingo today and Bulawayo tomorrow and other cities in due course.In an interview yesterday, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Dr Sylvia Utete-Masango, said the TPC would, among other things, act as a guide on who should be defined as a teacher. She said other professionals like the lawyers and doctors have professional standards bodies and the same should be done with teachers. This is what we re consulting on. It s at preliminary level. It entails the professional conduct of those that are in that sector. This is exactly what we trying to come up with, said Dr Utete-Masango.Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) chief executive officer Mr Sifiso Ndlovu welcomed the establishment of the regulatory body saying it was long overdue. It will not only be the regulator for educators but will also be a group that will be the vanguard for professional standards in the teaching profession in the country. This will also go a long way as the group will be a professional and authentic voice for education in the country. Because education is a specialised field, it must be given the professionalism it deserves, said Mr Ndlovu.He said the formation of the council would shut the door on any person who purports to be a teacher but is not trained for the job.@nqotshili
