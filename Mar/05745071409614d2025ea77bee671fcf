We lost three family members over the weekend. They were hit by a commuter omnibus that was rushing to town for passengers. They were walking coming from the barber shop when this commuter omnibus, which was travelling in the wrong lane as the driver was avoiding potholes, hit them. They all died on the spot, said Mr Mugovera.He said they were still to come to terms with the sudden death of their relatives.
