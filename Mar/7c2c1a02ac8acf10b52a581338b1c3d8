ZIMBABWE National Army boxers dominated the Open Boxing Tournament, winning seven out of the 10 contests held in Nyanyadzi last Saturday. Thulani Mupundu opened the door for ZNA boxers when he got the better of Lynott Jeyacheya of Manicaland in the light heavyweight category, while fellow ZNA boxer Beven Nyamhondera won against Ashly Makweya, also from Manicaland, in the light welterweight category.Other ZNA boxers that won were Chenjerai Makanyire (bantamweight), Emmanuel Chisiya (lightweight), Netsai Bondai (lightweight), Evance Usaviwevhu (welterweight), Arthur Million (bantamweight) and Felix Masinire (lightweight). Boxers came from Bulawayo, Matabeleland North, Harare, Midlands, Manicaland, Mashonaland East and the ZNA.Matabeleland South, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West and Masvingo were not represented.Although Masvingo was not represented as a province, individual boxers that felt could not miss the opportunity to prove themselves came on their own.Zimbabwe Boxing Federation vice-president Isaac Goora hailed the tournament saying it was an eye opener and a major success. The tournament was also key to ZBF boxers, as they prepare for the forthcoming Sadc Zone IV Games scheduled for Angola next month. The tournament also helped in assessing some of the boxers invited by the Zambian Boxing Federation for an amateur tournament set for Lusaka on March 4. The ZBF calendar will see more events lined up for 2017 taking place among them several other open tournaments at different places around the country.On March 25, all boxing provinces also converge at Victoria Falls for the second ZBF Open Tournament that Matabeleland North is going to host.International tournaments also make up part of the calendar, Goora said.Organised by the ZNA in conjunction with the ZBF, the tournament drew amateur boxers from six of the country s provinces, including the hosts.
