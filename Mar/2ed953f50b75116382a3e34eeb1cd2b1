Whinsley Masara recently in Victoria Falls INSTITUTIONS of higher learning have been urged to conduct research that addresses real life issues affecting Zimbabwe. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development, Dr Machivenyika Mapuranga, said this at the third annual research and innovation conference hosted by the Bulawayo Polytechnic that ended in Victoria Falls last Friday.The conference was a platform for the development of research initiatives that are Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) -oriented for the socio-economic transformation of Zimbabwe.The conference was held under the theme: TVETising and STEMitising through Research and Innovation for Socio-Economic Transformation. Researchers, academics, policy makers, business executives and practitioners in the area of TVET and STEM presented papers on researches they had undertaken.Dr Mapuranga said effective blending of TVET and STEM education can bring development to Zimbabwe.He applauded Bulawayo Polytechnic for sustaining a rich research culture in Technical and Vocational Education and Training. It is my hope that this research culture and tradition not only remains embedded in Bulawayo Polytechnic but continues to bring together STEMitised and TVETised researchers, technocrats, scholars and academics from diverse organisations and institutions to share ideas and findings that address real life issues affecting our country and region, he said. Higher and Tertiary institutions should therefore harness the STEM thrust to foster economic and technological revolutions that will spur Zimbabwe to unprecedented industrial and technological development. The intensive accumulation of scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes can subsequently lead to new technologies. TVET is the pragmatic vehicle for inventing these technological changes through its systematic blending with STEM. Dr Mapuranga said the systematic blending of STEM and TVET is the key to stronger, more responsive and development-oriented education that can transform the economy.He said research in TVET should also seek to advance curriculum innovation that effectively marries the Ministry s stemitisation thrust to the teaching and learning processes in Higher and Tertiary Institutions.Speaking at the same conference, Bulawayo Polytechnic Principal, Mr Gilbert Mabasa, said research is the only effective means through which industry and commerce can be transformed. Bulawayo Polytechnic continues to invest in this research as this is fundamentally the only effective means through which we can resuscitate and transform our industry and commerce. Research and innovation are the wheels that can foster effective and production Tvetisation and Stematisation for Zimbabwe, said Mr Mabasa.@winnie_masara
