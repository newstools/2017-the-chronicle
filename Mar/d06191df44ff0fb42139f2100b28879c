Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Sport and Recreation Ministry will hold a Women in Sport seminar at Coghlan Primary School on Saturday as part of International Women s Day celebrations that will be held in Bulawayo on Friday. Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) Bulawayo officer Rita Kutsirayi said the event seeks to examine current trends in women s sport. Girls and young women are a major target group and our goal is to create awareness around sport and physical activity for them. We hope young women will take away a positive message relating to staying active and about being treated equally in sport by the media, governing bodies, clubs, coaches and mentors. There is a special guest we have invited to facilitate the programme so we are really looking forward to making a difference in women s lives, said Kutsirayi.She said anyone interested in promoting women s participation in sport and physical activity such as parents, coaches and teachers are also invited to attend the event.She called on sporting associations to attend saying they would be taught how to attract sponsorship in their respective sporting disciplines.The event will also see women being taught about health and the importance of fitness and wellness in sport. While we all know the importance of involvement in sport from a physical perspective, the mental well being of young girls is also extremely important and sport can play a powerful role in promoting this. This fitness and wellness programme is part of the ministry s initiative to ensure that people live healthy lives and avoid premature deaths, Kutsirayi said.@khumzallen
