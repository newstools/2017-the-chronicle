 Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter AT least 200 swimmers are expected to battle it out at the the Junior National Swimming Championships to be held at Petra Primary School in Bulawayo today. The two-day competition will see defending champions Mashonaland Province trying to cement their dominance in the championships over their competitors. Mashonaland will battle it out against Manicaland, Midlands, Mashonaland Country District (MCD), Masvingo and the hosts, Matabeleland. Matabeleland swimming coach Demi Mooy said they are ready for the championships and is confident that her athletes will do well. “The province had their last training session on Thursday at the City Pool and from my assessment we are good to go. All the athletes really did some outstanding performances and as a coach I have faith in them,” said Mooy. Matabeleland Swimming Board chairperson Nokuthula Cyprianos said they are hoping for better results as they have selected a total of 55 swimmers for the competition which is a bigger number compared to last year’s. “This time we are sending a large number of athletes compared to last year’s. We hope that will work in our favour and earn us more points. We know we have struggled against Mashonaland Province but this time it won’t be a surprise if we turn the tables around. The guys have prepared very well and we have confidence in them. We hope they will be able to deliver and take advantage of being at home,” said Cyprianos. — @khumzallen
