Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League will hold an induction workshop for the four newly promoted clubs after its March 18 annual general meeting. Premiership returnees Bantu Rovers, Black Rhinos and Shabanie Mine, as well as first timers Yadah Gunners from the Zifa Eastern Region will take part in the workshop.PSL communications officer Kudzai Bare said the four clubs are expected to pay their affiliation fees in full before attending the workshop. The plan is to do the workshop before the start of the season. This induction workshop will be done once all the teams have paid their full affiliation fees and have also submitted all player registration documents. Participants at the workshop will be the four clubs chairpersons or presidents (governor), chief executive officers, communications officers and their security officers. The induction workshop is an orientation for newly promoted clubs to familiarise them with the statutes, club administration, licensing and marketing, among other things, Bare said.She said should any of the clubs submit a different structure, like the team being run by a marketing department, the PSL will accommodate those that have been seconded by the club.The PSL is also expected to send its team to look at the four clubs stadia before the start of the season. The 2017 season kicks off on April 1.Shabanie Mine s home ground is Maglas Stadium in Zvishavane, with Bulawayo-based Bantu Rovers expected to use either Luveve or White City stadiums, while Yadah Gunners are reportedly keen on playing their home matches at Chibuku Stadium in Chitungwiza.In their last PSL dance in 2014, army side Black Rhinos used Rimuka Stadium in Kadoma for their home matches and it remains to be seen whether they will return to the Mashonaland West town or relocate to the capital.Rhinos options in Harare include Gwanzura, Rufaro or the National Sports Stadium.Topflight clubs should also brace for more midweek games in the 2017 season, with each team now set to play 34 league matches.The league also has to factor in Fifa and Caf competitions in their calendar.- @ZililoR
