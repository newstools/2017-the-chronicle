Jason MachayaPatrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief THE Government has identified a peri-urban farm in Gweru to service residential stands to be allocated to women, youths, war veterans and civil servants. Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Jason Machaya said Worcestershire Farm which is located in Chiwundura, about 15km away from Gweru had been identified for the housing project. The farm can accommodate 14 500 stands, of which 4 500 will be allocated to youths while the remaining 10 000 will be distributed among liberation war veterans, women and civil servants, he said.Minister Machaya said the land will first be developed and fully serviced before the stands are allocated to the targeted beneficiaries.Minister Machaya, in the company of Tourism and Hospitality Industry Deputy Minister Cde Anastancia Ndlovu, Zanu-PF s Midlands Provincial Youth chairperson Cde Prosper Machando, Zimbuild Property Investments chief executive officer Dr Tinashe Manzungu and some government officials took the Zanu-PF youths to the farm on Wednesday.Cde Machando said the availing of the stands shows Government s commitment to empower youths. We are gathered here to show you progress, to show you that there is work on the ground in line with the vision of the ruling party under the leadership of President Mugabe to empower us the youths. You have seen that the land is available and the developer from Zimbuild is here. We will be allocated 4 500 stands as youths from this farm, he said.Cde Machando said the provision of stands was a fulfilment of promises made by the ruling party to the youth league. The ruling party has a mandate to empower youths as promised and we are going to see to it that we benefit through the allocation of these stands in the peri-urban area, said Mr Machando.He said contrary to lies being peddled by detractors, there was no double allocation of the farm adding that Zanu- PF had a history of doing things properly.Cde Ndlovu said it was high time that youths benefited from their land as part of Government s empowerment programme. It was unheard of before independence for youths to be owners of stands, so we stand resolute behind President Mugabe with his pro-people programmes, she said. @pchitumba1
