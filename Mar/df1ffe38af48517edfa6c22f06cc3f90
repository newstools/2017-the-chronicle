THE Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) president Philip Chiyangwa has refuted reports circulating on social media that he has been appointed Caf secretary-general. The Caf secretary-general post fell vacant when Hicham El Amrani of Morocco resigned at the weekend, a week after elections that swept long-standing president Issa Hayatou from power.The 37-year-old, who had served as secretary-general for the past six years, gave no reason for his decision. I understand that there is a story circulating on social media insinuating that I have been appointed to the position of Caf secretary-general. There is no such development and these are absolute falsehoods, said Chiyangwa. A Caf secretary-general is the head of Caf s secretariat and a full-time employee of the confederation. This is an inferior position to the ones I hold now, therefore, I do not harbour any ambitions whatsoever of landing that position. Above all, I currently hold far more superior positions to the vacant post. I am the president of both the Zimbabwe Football Association and Cosafa and it will be illogical for me to be appointed as the Caf secretary-general. I am also an advisor to the Caf president, who is also the vice-president of the Federation of International Football Associations (Fifa); zvidiki here izvozvo? (Are those small responsibilities?)
