There are good incentives this time around as we have increased the prize package by more than 17 percent from $13 700 to $16 100. We ve also scrapped the relay event and replaced it with the 10km race, which will start at Tshabalala Game Sanctuary. We expect a bigger turnout this time around and that is why we ve decided to have the competition on Saturday instead of Sunday so that people who will register for the race get time to recover before starting their working week, said Mapuma.By introducing the 10km race, organisers have made it easier for school going athletes to participate in the competition.In their quest to attract a big turnout, organisers have also arranged an aerobics session to be held in Bulawayo a week before the competition.
