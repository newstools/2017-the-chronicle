We were shocked when we heard that she had cut her son s privates. Neighbours said she called them screaming for help after chopping the manhood which she described as too big for his age, she said. We re equally shocked and sad that the boy will live without his manhood for the rest of his life. It was a traumatic incident and we hope both him and the mother will recover.

A nurse who spoke on condition of anonymity said the child had suffered a traumatic amputation. This child came here sometime in January and we didn t see the piece of the cut manhood. We have been treating and nursing him since then as his mother had to be taken to Ingutsheni Central Hospital. She had become a hazard to the child and other patients as she exhibited violent tendencies, said the nurse.@thamamoe
