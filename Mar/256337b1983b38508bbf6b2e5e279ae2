Nceku Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent POPULAR social media comedian Nceku (real name Thuba Sibanda) is set to launch his debut comic DVD in Bulawayo on Saturday. The DVD titled, ‘I am Nceku’ was recorded live at Robert Sibson Hall and is two hours long. It will be released on Facebook on the Nceku fan page with DVDs already available. Nceku, a Christian comedian, will be one of the first social media sensations to take his comic works to a different platform as he targets a new audience. Unlike his usual skits on social media which are usually less than 10 minutes long, the DVD will also act as a tent pole to cushion Nceku from only existing in a virtual space. If marketed well, Nceku may soon be gracing various stages. His spokesperson, Wisdom Nyathi, said the DVD launch comes after a successful debut show that was held late last year. “The show titled I am Nceku was an introductory outside the virtual world. This DVD launch comes as an insight to those who didn’t attend the show last year,” said Nyathi. “I am Nceku is a unique two hour work of comedy. The comedian went an extra mile and packaged new jokes that are set to win the hearts of many.” Nyathi said the DVD would be available at affordable prices at the launch party. “We’ll make sure that the DVD will be affordable so that everyone buys a copy at the launch. The idea is to expose people to Nceku,” he said.
