The accused persons have been on remand once and no one can say there is delay in bringing the matter to trial considering the nature of investigations that are underway, said Mr Tashaya.He said refusal of further remand can be granted when the court is satisfied that further remand violates the accused persons rights. I was going to grant your application if you were over detained at the police station or if the police assaulted or tortured you. Refusal of further remand can be granted if there are delays in bringing the accused persons for trial, Mr Tashaya said.The magistrate remanded the cops out of custody to March 14 and said the State would continue with investigations and give the accused persons a trial date.Advocate Sampson Samuel Mlaudzi is representing Chikonamombe while Mr Bryon Sengweni is representing Shonhiwa.Mr Kucaca Ivumile Phulu is representing Moyo.Assistant Inspector Oswald Mushonga (33) appeared separately before the same magistrate facing the same charge and was also remanded out of custody to March 14.The court heard how the cops allegedly stole $206 048.47.Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said between September 21 and December 31, 2016, Shonhiwa, Mushonga and Fidelis Chivavava connived and signed internal funds transfer slips authorising Standard Chartered Bank to transfer $14 785 from Ntabazinduna Training Depot s Mess account into Dube, Moyo and Sibanda s accounts.Chivavava, who is already on remand for the same charge, was the acting finance clerk at ZRP Ntabazinduna Training Depot responsible for withdrawing, holding in trust the withdrawn funds, conducting payments for suppliers and reconciling the money.Between 2015 and 2016, Chikonamombe allegedly connived with Chivavava and signed an order to pay suppliers using already paid invoices for acquittals and in the process prejudicing their employer of $144 014,29.Mr Dlodlo said during the same year, Chikonamombe and Chivavava signed another order and purportedly indicated in the financial books that they paid Oscaria Bakery and Fortwell Wholesalers thereby prejudicing ZRP of $147 214,29.Between January 18 and 19 this year, an internal audit was carried out at ZRP Ntabazinduna Training Depot and it was discovered that a total of $206 048,47 was missing from the coffers.
