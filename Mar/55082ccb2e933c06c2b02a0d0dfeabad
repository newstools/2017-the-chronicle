Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter ZIMPOST says local and international money transfer services have helped stabilise the company and boost earnings. Through its Zipcash unit, Zimpost s customers can send or receive money locally and internationally through the postal network.Zimpost acting managing director, Mr Chief Moyo, said the service has been experiencing growth since its inception in 2013 due to its low rates on money transfers. Zipcash can be accessed by anyone without necessarily being tied to a bank account and the service is also available locally at the company s 248 outlets that are accessible even in remote areas and this has vastly increased the company s client base, said Mr Moyo.He said they were also transacting with Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania.Mr Moyo said that the company has the largest retail network in the country and hoped its partnership with WorldRemit will help bring the much needed foreign currency in the country.Last month Zimpost partnered with WorldRemit, a global remittance service player, as part of efforts to broaden business. WorldRemit will assist Zimbabweans abroad to send money to their loved ones in any part of the country thereby bringing convenience and financial inclusion in Zimbabwe. This will also help in bringing the much needed foreign currency into the country, he said.Mr Moyo said the company has embraced the use of plastic money. Zimpost has deployed point of sale machines in its outlets and its customers are finding it easy to transact. The company is not constrained at all by the use of plastic money, he said. The migration of the services to the e-platform will bring convenience to customers. Our new innovations will be driven by customer needs and will be offered through the use of modern technologies. The company is projecting to generate $22 million revenue this year.@Kiyaz_Cool
