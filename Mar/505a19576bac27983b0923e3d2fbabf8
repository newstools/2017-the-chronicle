Nkululeko NkalaBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent PLANS to host the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) to recognise and honour artistes from the city and Matabeleland North/ South provinces are underway. The inaugural awards, if all goes according to plan, will be held at the Large City Hall on June 30.One of the organisers of the awards, Nkululeko Nkala, said the awards would be launched at the Bulawayo Club next week Wednesday. Details on how one can participate or enter the awards will be unpacked there.Nkala said artistes would be honoured in 10 categories for Music, Theatre, Dance, Literary Art, Poetry, Comedy, Fashion, Film, Visual Art and Media.He said they were hosting the awards to recognise efforts made by Bulawayo artistes and those from surrounding provinces. The Bulawayo Arts Awards are not meant to counter any awards or forms of recognition in Bulawayo or the country in general, but are meant to complement the efforts that are already being made to recognise and honour artistes from the Matabeleland region, said Nkala.The awards come at a time when Bulawayo artistes have been crying foul over the years claiming they were not being recognised at national level. There has been discontentment with regards to the outcomes of national awards including Zima and Nama.If they come to fruition, the Bulawayo Music Awards will be the second regional awards ceremony following the Midlands Music Awards.&nbsp;
