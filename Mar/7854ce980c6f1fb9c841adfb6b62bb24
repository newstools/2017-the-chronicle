Elvis MoyoRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MIXED Martial Arts (MMA) analyst Simons Stephens has described tomorrow s fight between Zimbabwe heavyweight cage fighter Elvis Moyo and South African Mike Vermeulen as fascinating and likely to be decided by a knockout. In a video preview of the fight set for Carnival City, Johannesburg, Stephens said: There s always a buzz in the air when big guys clash in the hexagon.These are big guys with incredible power. It is going to be a fascinating fight. Moyo, whose stage name is Bulawayo Bomber, says he is ready to make up for his Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) Africa title fight loss to Andrew van Zyl in October last year and will use the bout against Vermeulen to get on with his plan of another title shot.Vermeulen also wants to hammer Moyo and enhance his chances of getting a shot at the title. I know I ll be victorious. I ve put in lots of time and dedication to the sport. I won t run around or run away from him, I ll get into his face, said Vermeulen.Moyo promised to smash his opponent. I ve reloaded and am ready to smash Mike (Vermeulen). I ve watched some of his fights and have noted that he is a rusher and throws random punches. I will use his body as my punching bag and I intend to stop him within seven minutes. I can t lose to Mike because if I do, it will be like taking many steps back, said Moyo.Moyo will have to be at his best to overcome Vermeulen, who has four career wins out of five. The South African will also be seeking to stretch his unbeaten run to five fights.What makes Vermeulen a tricky opponent is that he won his last fight in October against Poland s Tomasz Kredka Kowalkowski, who knocked out Moyo in just 37 seconds in 2015.Moyo has seven career wins from 11 cage fights. @ZililoR.
