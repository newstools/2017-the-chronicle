Jiggaz with his suvShowbiz Reporter Zim Dancehall star Jiggaz has put his VW Touareg SUV for sale due to high maintenance costs. The 34-year-old singer said he could not afford to service the SUV although he claimed everything was going on well for him. It s just that due to high maintenance costs involved in servicing the car, I ve decided to sell it. Most garages are failing to stock spare parts for the car due to foreign currency squeeze and that s untenable for me, he said.The Touareq offers true 4 4 capabilities off-road, and a smooth, luxurious and powerful ride on it, thanks to its four wheel drive technology, 4MOTION .Besides being a musician, Jiggaz, born George Tanjani, is also a film actor of note. Of course I do not make much money through music so I m also an actor. That s where I get most of my money so things are looking pretty good for me, Jiggaz explained.He said he was putting final touches on a new single Criminal Gyal which he hopes will put him on the international scene. He recently did a collabo with Guspy Warrior which is doing the rounds on some radio stations. I ve shifted from just being a Zimbabwean artiste as I ve my eyes set on penetrating the international market. I do a lot of English songs because I want to reach out to foreigners, the Chinese, Europeans, Indians and everybody else. Turning to the big screen, Jiggaz has been featured in a number of productions including television series Pfuma and comedy Decorder . We re working on a TV series called Baobab Ridge that ll be on television soon, said Jiggaz.Many will remember Jiggaz for his drubbing at the Chipaz Sting contest held in Harare where he brought a coffin intending to bury his rival Badman but unfortunately he lost the tune-fi-tune contest and was literally buried in his own coffin.
