Eddie Chikamhi and Paul Mundandi ZIFA have suspended Harare City Football Club media liaison officer Hope Chizuzu from all football-related activities over a slew of allegations against the establishment. Chizuzu, a veteran sports journalist and television football pundit, stands accused of misrepresentation and fabricating falsehoods.In a letter that was copied to Harare City FC chairman Alois Masepe, Fifa, Caf and Cosafa, Zifa chief executive Joseph Mamutse said Chizuzu should relinquish his post at Harare City with immediate effect.Mamutse said Chizuzu had shown absolute disdain and disregard of the Zifa constitution and had brought the Association into disrepute because of his misconduct.Sources claimed Chizuzu, who wanted to contest the Zifa elections before pulling out at the last minute, was the source of a fake article claiming Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa had been summoned to Egypt by Caf this week for a disciplinary hearing.In fact, Chiyangwa was invited by his Egyptian counterparts and not Caf.Chizuzu, however, was not interested when contacted for comment yesterday in light of the various allegations laid against him. I don t have an interest in that matter so I have no comment to make. I think they have done what they know best so if ever there was going to be a comment it should come from them. It s them saying they have suspended me so I don t have anything to say about that. If it was myself making the allegations then it was a different issue, said Chizuzu.However, the Harare City spokesperson was yesterday handed the notice of provisional expulsion from all football roles and activities with the decision expected to be ratified at the next congress.The letter was copied to Masepe the Chairman of Harare City who are the immediate employers of Chizuzu.It was also copied to Fifa secretary general, Caf secretary general, Cosafa secretary general, Zifa president, Zifa vice president and Zifa executive committee members and their legal advisor.
