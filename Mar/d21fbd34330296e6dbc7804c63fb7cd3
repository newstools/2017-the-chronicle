The team is made up of four women and 11 men.Body Works Gym manager Donovan Ashborne said all bodybuilders had booked their tickets to Harare following a selection competition held on Saturday. We have faith they are going to do us proud and are hoping to grab the title that has eluded us in previous years, which is the Mr Novice. As Bulawayo we have dominated this competition in the ladies category through Shantel Greenland, who won in 2015 and Selina Manuel, who won last year. The men s category has always been a tough one so we are looking forward to bringing that one to Bulawayo. I am also happy because this time there are more ladies taking up the sport, said Ashborne.Last year s competition saw 37-year-old Muchineripi Katena of Gweru being crowned Mr Novice after seeing off the challenges of 12 other athletes that had taken to the stage.Manuel (17) was crowned Ms Novice 2016.TeamUnder-21 men: Zibani Dube, Blessing Tumbubwa, Rodney ChirarapasiMen Fitness: Tapiwa Zimhunda, Justice Chikava, Gabriel Gwapedza, Keith MombeshoraSenior men: Thembinkosi Lunga, Taurai Chimbiwa, Dumolihle Maziswa, Marvellous GandahSenior women: Faithful Nyaku, Khethiwe Ncube, Lydia Bhebhe, Eulene Ndlovu.@khumzallen
