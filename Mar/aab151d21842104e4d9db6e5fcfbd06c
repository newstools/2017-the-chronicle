Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Lubumbashi, DRC THERE was no official to welcome Caps United when they touched down at the Lubumbashi Airport in the Democratic Republic of Congo just after 9AM for their Caf Champions League first leg second round tie against TP Mazembe yesterday. International football etiquette requires that a visiting team be met by their hosts and be escorted by state police, but Makepekepe were led by one car, which also carried the head of delegation, Matabeleland South Zifa chairman Patrick Hill. We have no one to welcome us as you can see, said Hill at the airport.However, the cold reception did little to dampen the Caps United players jovial mood under cloudy tropical skies, as they were not at all concerned about the apparent administrative abuse by the hosts. We are happy and ready for battle; everyone is fully focused. All we want is to play and get back home, hopefully with a positive result, said captain Hardlife Zvirekwi.Unregistered but influential forward, veteran Leonard Tsipa, travelled with the squad to offer moral support. Tsipa is here with us just to give moral support to the guys, said Caps United chief executive officer Cuthbert Chitima.Caps United were expected to fly back home after the match last night.
