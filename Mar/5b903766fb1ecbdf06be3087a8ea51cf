Sports Reporter EXPLOSIVE battles are expected at the second edition of the Tertiary Institutions Rugby Tournament at Hartsfield Rugby Grounds in Bulawayo next week. The tournament, which features teams from the country s universities and colleges, has been designed to capture and nurture the talent that comes through the school system.Inaugural winners Great Zimbabwe University are expected to defend their title on March 11.Tournament director, Francorn Mutare, said preparations are almost complete. We are expecting no less than nine teams on this day of rugby extravaganza. We are also looking forward to high level competition because most of the players from the Under-21 league that has been taking place in recent weeks were also coming from these institutions. The purpose of holding this tournament is to help groom the potential that we have in the colleges and universities. We have noted that schools rugby in Zimbabwe is very strong but it s not possible for those guys to just break into the first teams at the country s top teams. That is where tertiary and university rugby should come in to bridge the gap. Usually we have very good players at schools rugby level but once these guys leave school the talent is lost because there is nothing to rekindle interest in the players. Some would choose to go and play abroad or while others stop playing rugby at all and concentrate on other career pathways. Rugby at this level should be a warehouse for the nation s talents hence the need to take it seriously. So, we are hoping to make this an official pre-season tournament for the universities and tertiary colleges while we discuss the possibility of coming up with regional leagues, said Mutare.Winners will be presented with trophies and medals. There are also going to be individual prizes for the best player overall, the best backline and the best forward player.
