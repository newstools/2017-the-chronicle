Thulani Biya NcubeAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIFA Bulawayo Province has honoured the Biya and Friends Soccer Academy for their generous support for junior football. The academy was formed by former Highlanders and Warriors skipper Thulani Ncube in 2015 as a way of giving back to the community. The academy caters for Under-12, Under-14 and Under-16 boys.Zifa Bulawayo Province chairman Francis Ntutha said the association felt obliged to honour the academy as it has played a major role in developing soccer at the grassroots level as well as promoting education among its players. Over the years the Biya and Friends Academy has been holding some tournaments around Bulawayo and as a board we felt we should honour them for the wonderful work they have been doing. Another thing is that they promote education as they have been assisting players with paying their school fees and buying stationery. Even in their awards, those who excelled were given some books, said Ntutha.He also called on current and former players not to forget their roots once they get to topflight football. If only the province had more people like Thulani, we would be far in terms of junior football. We hope they will continue doing this work and as a board we appreciate their efforts. On our side, we will also continue honouring those who make a difference in the communities, Ntutha said.The honour comes a week after Zifa Southern Region chairman Musa Mandaza hailed Bulawayo Province for a vibrant junior policy.Mandaza said Bulawayo boasts of being the only province in the country with a junior league that has produced teams like Bantu Rovers, who made it to the topflight league with the bulk of its players being Under-20.@khumzallen
