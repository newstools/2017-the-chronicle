Lovemore Zigara in Gweru THE Midlands Netball Association (MNA) will hold a meeting today where the provincial league is expected to be launched. The provincial league failed to kick-off last year after some clubs failed to secure sponsorship to run the full course of the season. This followed the premature end of the 2015 season as some clubs continuously failed to fulfil fixtures. MNA secretary Abigail Mlangeni was, however, confident that despite the setbacks in the past two years, they would have enough clubs to feature in the provincial league. “The league executive is meeting on Saturday to map the way forward in terms of coming up with a provincial league, which we hope will start at the beginning of April if all goes according to plan. If we manage to get six clubs, we can go ahead with forming a league,” said Mlangeni. “So far some clubs have already expressed interest in taking part in the league, with some that could not make it in the national super league wanting to join. I am therefore appealing to clubs that want to join us to approach our executive,” she said. Buchwa Mine and Mnene High School are some of the clubs that have been part of the league before and are expected to feature in the new league. Meanwhile, the national netball super league action kicks off this weekend with matches lined up across the country. A Midlands derby is in the offing today between Zvishavane-based Platinum Queens and Shurugwi Queens. Meanwhile, Bulawayo’s White City today plays host to a primary and secondary schools’ pre-season tournament. — @lavuzigara1
