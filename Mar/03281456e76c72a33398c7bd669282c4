Mr Dan MoyoAuxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter RETIRED Bulawayo Provincial Education director Mr Dan Moyo has encouraged teachers to embrace the new curriculum and work on addressing its shortcomings. Mr Moyo who received a standing ovation for his sterling contribution to the country s education sector at a farewell party yesterday, said it was important to adopt the new curriculum to ensure pupils are equipped with life skills.The party for the long serving teacher and director was organised by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and other stakeholders. Ladies and gentlemen, I m going out at the time the new curriculum has come on board, all I can say is it s good that we consulted the people, it s good that people came out with their views. It s good that we condense these views into syllabi, said Mr Moyo.He urged teachers to note challenges they face when implementing the new curriculum so that they could be addressed during a review of the cirriculum. To those at school, district and provincial level, can you please note down whatever you see is going wrong. When you feel this cannot work, let s note that one down because as this curriculum is being implemented there is strong monitoring and evaluation,, said Mr Moyo.He said when monitoring teams visit the schools, teachers should point out the shortcomigns they want addressed.Mr Moyo said the success in the education sector was mainly based on team work. You will never succeed when you are underrating others, when you look down upon others then you know you have a problem. When you begin to be biased to say this section of the population belongs this side and these others endai uko, you are going to destroy everything, said Mr Moyo.Acting Bulawayo PED, Mrs Olicah Kaira said Mr Moyo leaves behind a legacy of discipline, honesty and dignity which would be greatly missed. He was a father figure, an advisor, a good listener and counsellor and an excellent manager for the province. We wish him a well-deserved retirement calling on him to avail himself to us when we need a renowned educational consultant, said Mrs Kaira.During his tenure Mr Moyo initiated programmes like the National University of Science and Technology enhancement programme (NUSTEP) for sciences and mathematics and Lupane State University enhancement programme (LUCEP) for commercial subjects.He was also heavily involved in sport development and says after retirement he wishes to pursue his passion full-time.Mr Moyo retired at the age of 65 in December last year after 42 years of of service.@AuxiliaK
