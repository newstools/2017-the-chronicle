Emmet NdlovuRaymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent HIGHLANDERS have reportedly asked the organisers of the Royal Cup to deposit $7 000 into the club s coffers before the Bulawayo giants can play against Swaziland giants Manzini Wanderers at Barbourfields Stadium. The match is penciled for 19 March.The winners will pocket $10 000 while the losing finalists will get $7 000, according to the organisers of the cup game the Royal Cup Trust. The figures that you are talking about were mentioned in a closed door meeting between Highlanders and the Royal Cup Trust and it would unprofessional for me to make the details of that meeting public. We are working around the clock to meet the demands of the two teams as well as seeking permission from the relevant authorities for the match to go ahead, said Royal Cup Trust chief executive officer Nkosilathi Ndiweni.In the event that Bosso win the match then the organisers will top up an additional $3 000 .Word coming from the Highlanders camp is that the club wants to avoid a repeat of past incidents where the team has taken part in some tournaments but never paid.The club is then forced to dig deeper into its coffers to pay appearance fees and winning bonuses for the players. The club is facing an $800 000 debt and part of that debt accumulated as a result of taking part in tournaments where the club ends up not getting paid winning prizes. This time around we want to safeguard the interests of the club, said a well placed Highlanders source.Bosso secretary-general Emmett Ndlovu said the organisers of the cup have until Monday to make a final decision. The ball is now in the Royal Cup organiser s court because they have until Monday to make their final position because we are working on a tight pre-season schedule that was drawn up by the technical team. We will play football on 19 March be it the proposed cup game or against any other team. It takes days for a match to be cleared by the PSL and other authorities so we need time to plan accordingly, said Ndlovu. @RaymondJaravaza&nbsp;
