Q DubeKiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter AWARD winning comedian Q Dube is in South Africa attending the Johannesburg International Comedy Festival. The festival being held at The Alexander Theatre is running under the theme Stand Up Africa .Q Dube who performs today is expected to share the stage with renowned Nigerian comedian Basketmouth.The comedian said: I m very humbled to be representing Zimbabwe in the midst of powerful comics. It s an honour and encouragement for me to keep on doing what I m doing. Q Dube said local comics needed to value their works and always know that the sky is the limit. When an opportunity arises, fellow comedians should grab it. I hope it doesn t take them as long as it took me to be recognised outside borders, but in case it does, patience and consistency is a virtue. Artistes should value their works and try maintaining originality, he said.He said performing outside the country was not a challenge for his act because his material is universal. @Kiyaz_Cool.
