Ingwebu plant premisesKiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter INGWEBU Breweries has introduced breathalyser check system on its workers as a precautionary measure to curb work-related accidents, an official has said. A breathalyser is a device used for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breath sample. This machine can detect mouth alcohol recently consumed when one starts to blow. It also detects a high concentration of alcohol present at the start of the process.Ingwebu Sales, Marketing and Corporate Affairs Manager Mr Prince Ndlovu said the breathalyser was introduced last week as a way of protecting workers from accidents that occur in the work place when they work under the influence of alcohol. You know here at Ingwebu we brew beer so we want our workers to be careful not to be involved in accidents when they are under the influence of alcohol.We value their safety at work that is why we have introduced breathalysers in order to minimise accidents that happen at work, said Mr Ndlovu.He said the firm wanted to protect its workers from operating heavy machinery under the influence of alcohol as this was risky with a possibility of loss of life. There is heavy machinery here and we don t want to hear cases of death and injuries when people operate under the influence of alcohol. Breathalysers will help reduce such cases to minimum, said Mr Ndlovu.He said workers were also happy with the initiative as they also believe in safety while on duty. Since the introduction of breathalysers we did not hear cases of disciplinary action and this shows workers have welcomed the move in order to protect their safety at work, said Mr Ndlovu.Last month the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) reported that it had started implementing a programme to privatise Ingwebu Breweries in order to turn around the local authority s commercial undertaking.The council said the major thrust of the privatisation of the brewery was to protect the local authority and stop accumulation of further debts.@Kiyaz_Cool
