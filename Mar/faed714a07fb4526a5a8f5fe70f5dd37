It appears she was HIV positive but she recently defaulted on her medication and became critically ill. This frustrated her because at one time her relatives caught her trying to drink a dipping chemical and when they asked she said she wanted to kill herself because her illness was unbearable. Her family says she was constantly making threats of ending her life, he said.Chief Kandana said the woman woke up in the middle of the night on Monday and went to a dam which is about 100 metres away from her home.She allegedly threw herself in and drowned.The woman s 14-year-old daughter was sleeping in the same room with her mother but did not hear her leave the hut. The chief said on the following morning, the girl realised that her mother was not home and went to look for her. The teenager found her mother s body floating in the water at around 8AM and she alerted neighbours abou twhat had transpired.
