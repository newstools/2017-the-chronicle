He ll be here next Friday, but before hitting the Club 263 stage, Boom Beto will do flash mobs at some other clubs in Bulawayo including Club Connect and Private Lounge, said DJ Nash.He said they were hosting Boom Beto mainly because he was the man of the moment in Zimdancehall circles whom they want to inspire other up-and-coming Zimdancehall artistes in Bulawayo. There s a Bulawayo Zimdancehall Association (BZAM) that was recently formed in Bulawayo so Boom Beto is expected to meet members from this association to share notes. We want artistes here to blend with those in Harare so that we have a strong Zimdancehall movement, DJ Nash said.The BZAM, which includes artistes, DJs, MCs, Recording Studios and promoters aims to uplift Bulawayo Zimdancehall. The Zimdancehall genre has really grown in Bulawayo and we ll continue supporting it so that artistes specialising in that genre here like Centre Party and DJ Tawaz can also be known and recognised at various awards held nationally, said DJ Nash.
