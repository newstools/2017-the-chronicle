 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Plumtree Correspondent A PLUMTREE cop has been fined $100 after he failed to negotiate a turn and hit a police vehicle at a robot controlled intersection in the border town. Farai Chimboora (31), a constable who is stationed at the Plumtree Police Station was convicted on his own plea of guilty to driving without due care and attention by Plumtree magistrate Mr Joshua Mawere. He was fined $100 or sentenced to two months imprisonment in case of default. Chimboora who was driving his own vehicle hit a police Ford Ranger that was being driven by Constable Artwell Maphosa while it was stationary at the intersection. Prosecuting, Mr Elisha Mazorodze said the incident occurred on November 5 last year at around 10PM. “Chimboora was driving a Toyota Gaia and he approached a robot controlled intersection at the 100 kilometre peg along Bulawayo-Plumtree Road. “He went on to turn to his left but he failed to turn properly and encroached into the lane of a Ford Ranger which was stationary as it was being controlled by a red robot,” he said. Mr Mazorodze said Chimboora hit the police car on its right side and damaged the prop shaft and the rear axle. He said Chimboora failed to drive with due care and attention or reasonable consideration for other people resulting in his arrest. In mitigation, Chimboora said he had erred. He said he paid for the police vehicle’s repairs. — @DubeMatutu
