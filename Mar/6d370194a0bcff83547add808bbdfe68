Omega SibandaAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIFA vice-president Omega Sibanda has bemoaned the lack of female participants at the association s Level One coaching course that started on Monday at Raylton Sports club in Bulawayo. Sibanda said it was high time women got involved in such courses as their game is fast developing in the country. It is not a good thing that out of 40 participants we have only four women attending this programme. This is a cause for concern and I think women should start attending these courses because their sport is fast developing. As an association, we are going to organise their own coaching courses at very low fees so that we also empower them, said Sibanda, while officially opening the course.The beginners course being facilitated by veteran instructor Gibson Homela and Oscar Mazhambe is part of a series of training and development programmes targeting coaches, administrators and referees.Sibanda also challenged aspiring coaches to exercise professionalism once they start coaching. This is a good step that you aspiring coaches are taking. Don t stop at this level, but go all the way up. Once you get there, remember that you have a duty to develop soccer in the country and always remember to exercise professionalism. There have been reports of age cheating so we don t want to see you being one of those. Some coaches go to the extent of facilitating bribes from players so that they get into their starting line-ups, Sibanda said. You should also avoid arguing with your bosses as that can have a negative impact on your career. Your conduct as a coach will determine the kind of players you will produce. Always remember to choose your players on merit and do not hold grudges against players, he said.@khumzallen
