Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe National Paralympic Games fundraising committee for the 10th edition to be held in Bindura early next month have partnered with renowned accounting firm PFK Chartered Accountants in a move aimed at instilling confidence in potential donors. The Games will be held from April 7-11and a budget of $750 000 has been set and adopted.PFK Chartered Accountants will be mandated with auditing all proceeds raised and disbursed prior to and during the Games.Chairperson of the fundraising committee Rumbidzai Kamba said as partners of the Sports and Recreation Commission, they believed in transparency and assuring prospective that their resources would not be misused. One of our key values as ZiMwana WorldWide Trust is transparency in whatever we do and to this end, we always endeavour to not only satisfy our clients, but also ensure that we report accurately on how we would have utilised the resources extended to us by various partners, said Kamba. We are fully cognisant of the fact that these are public funds and as such they must be fully accounted for. Many times we have read or heard some people or organisations failing to account for resources that they would have received from different partners. This does not only dampen the spirit of donors, it also tarnishes the image of genuine aid seekers. It is for this reason that we have taken this bold step so that we assure whoever is going to donate to us that their investment will be channelled accordingly. The Zimbabwe National Paralympic Games, Kamba said, are an important milestone in the local sporting calendar and as such there is need for all Zimbabweans to support them. Let us all rally behind efforts to raise resources to fund the Games so that they become memorable to people living with disabilities, Kamba said.@skhumoyo2000
