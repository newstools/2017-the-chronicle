Cde KasukuwereThupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Government has called on local authorities to work on connecting water and sewer reticulation facilities to houses built under Operation Garikayi/Hlalani Kuhle in 2005. The Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, said local authorities should work with the beneficiaries and land developers in servicing the areas which have been without such facilities including electricity since the programme was launched.The minister was responding to allegations that most local authorities across the country are reluctant to service the areas saying the onus lies with central Government. Local authorities are urged to work together with the beneficiaries and land developers to service the areas with water and sewer reticulation facilities.This talk of waiting for central government to carry out the task is not progressive, said Cde Kasukuwere.The minister said water is a basic need and there must be no compromise on its provision.He said it was also important for the local authorities and residents to be proactive and pool resources to improve water and sewer facilities.In 2005, the government carried out operation Murambatsvina to rid cities and urban centres of illegal structures and unlicensed trading practices in the form of flea markets, tuck-shops and pavement vending.This was followed by a two phased mass housing programme with a target of 5 000 houses to replace destroyed illegal structures.A total of 3 311 houses, 41 vendor marts and 17 factory shells were built across the country in the first phase.The second phase was an aided self-help programme where developers, cooperatives and individuals were allocated un-serviced land to build 10 000 houses on their own.In 2008 government handed over projects related to Garikayi/Hlalani Kuhle to local authorities for further management, but these have been playing hide and seek when it comes to setting up water and sewer facilities.The Chairman of the town clerks forum, Dr George Makunde, said there was a need for local authorities and the beneficiaries to agree on specific issues peculiar to their respective areas. You will note that resources have been the greatest challenge in servicing the land with water, sewer and roads. Apparently the service charges by government before 2008 when the projects were handed over to local authorities were lower than expected for us to make the houses habitable, he said. This has resulted in some people resisting the proposed costs to service specific areas, hence emphasis should be on both parties sitting down and agreeing on a payment model that will expedite the process .&nbsp;
