Nation DubeTobias Mandoreba in Hwange HWANGE FC have unveiled a 28-member squad for the 2017 Premier Soccer League campaign that is expected to kick-off early next month. Returning head coach Nation Dube is confident the selected players will hold their own in this campaign. We have concluded our pre-season trials and came up with a balanced squad to do the job for Hwange this year. People might read much into the departure of a number of players in the off-season, but from the assessment so far, this squad has a point to prove that Hwange remains a big brand in our league, said Dube. We also hope besides the recent friendly against Chicken Inn where I noted lots of positives, we can have an opportunity to play at least two more PSL sides before the season starts, but generally I am happy to be back doing the work I love so much. With teamwork and everyone s support, we can make Hwange fans happy at the end of the season. The 2017 squad still has experienced captain Gerald Ndlovu, who is expected to marshal the defence, supported by another veteran Obert Moyo and young Wilfred Munorwei.In goals, first choice keeper Tymon Mvula keeps his position, but should expect stiff competition from former FC Platinum Under-19 goalkeeper Collen Phiri, who retraced his footsteps back to his hometown.Experienced midfielders Oscar Lungu, Collen Muleya and Andrew Tshuma remained loyal to the coalminers and their work rate will be crucial for Hwange, although competition for jerseys will come from the likes of Nomore Chinyerere and Shepherd Gadzikwa, formerly of ZPC Hwange and Vic Falls Tigers respectively.Ageless striker, Gilbert Zulu, will again seek to prove that age is nothing but a number when he leads the Hwange strike force.Also expected to provide firepower upfront are Admire Banda and the incoming Muli Jimu and Tendai Mate.The coalminers are virtually building from scratch after losing almost the entire team for various reasons during off-season.Goalkeepers Future Sibanda, David Bizabani and London Zulu left the club alongside defenders David Boriwondo, Phakamani Dube and Munyaradzi Mungadze, as well as promising youngsters Andrew Tandi and Tonisani Sibelo.In midfield, Hwange lost Innocent Mucheneka, Farai Vimisai and Pritchard Mpelele, while the most notable loss upfront was that of Gift Mbeti to Zvishavane-based side FC Platinum.Pervington Zimunya and Newman Sianchali also joined the exodus.Hwange FC 2017 squadGoalkeepers: Tymon Mvula, Collen Phiri Defenders: Gerald Ndlovu, Melvin Mukiwa, Clayton Phiri, Houdlacks Kaunda, Morestuf Ncube, Wilfred Munorwei, Obert Moyo, Kudakwashe Matake.Midfielders: Collen Muleya, Nomore Chinyerere, Shepherd Gadzikwa, Takudzwa Chichevo, Admire Banda, Oscar Lungu, Andrew Tshuma, Craven Banda, Clavelo NyoniStrikers: Justin Kaunda, Tendai Mate, Gilbert Zulu, Jimu Muli.DEVELOPMENT PLAYERS: Josias Mumpande, Keith Mumba, Charlton Nyathi, Rivaldo Tshuma, Ted Ncube.@tobymandox
