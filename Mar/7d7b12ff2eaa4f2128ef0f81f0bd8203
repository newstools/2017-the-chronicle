Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU United have started renovating Ascot Stadium as they move to comply with club licensing. In Zvishavane, Premiership returnees Shabanie Mine said they would be done with renovations at Maglas Stadium before the season kicks off this weekend.Ascot Stadium and Maglas Stadium are some of the facilities that were condemned by the Zifa Grounds Committee recently.The committee cited the absence of ablution facilities in the VIP area and the absence of a media area, among other defects, at Ascot Stadium.Maglas Stadium s turf and other minor renovations were cited.Hillary Jona, the Chapungu chairman, said contractors were expected to be on site today. We engaged (Gweru City) Council over the issue and I am happy that there is good co-operation between us and them. Yesterday (Monday) we finalised the issue of the renovation of the stadium with them. We have identified the contractor and the bill of quantities is there, said Jona. We are therefore expecting the contractor on the ground tomorrow (today) to start work and we are hopeful that by mid-season we would have fulfilled the requirements of the club licensing system .He could, however, not be drawn into disclosing how much the club is pouring into the renovations at the stadium.Jona said the club had in principle agreed on a lease agreement with the local authority, which is also a requirement under the new club licensing regime.At Maglas Stadium, work has already started with the turf being worked on as well as alterations at some sections of the stadium. We are happy with the progress that we have made so far and I am confident that when we play Caps United on Sunday we would have met all the requirements that have been cited by the Grounds Committee, said Shabanie Mine chairman Elias Marufu.He was, however, non-committal on the issue of club head coach Taku Shariwa, who, according to the Club licensing system should not head the dugout since he does not have a Caf A Licence, the minimum qualification for one to coach a Premiership side.Shariwa was barking instructions from the bench on Sunday when Shabanie Mine beat Ngezi Platinum 1 0 in a practice game at Maglas Stadium.@lavuzigara1
