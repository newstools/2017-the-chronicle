Nathi MankayiAfro-soul singer Nathi and his band were robbed of their valuables at gunpoint in the early hours of yesterday morning. They had just landed from Gabon where they were performing as part of a Department of Arts and Culture delegation.According to a source it seems like Nathi and his band were robbed by the notorious syndicate that follows unsuspecting people from O R Tambo. Nathi and his band were driving to Auckland Park and they had to drop the keyboard player at the Milpark Flats when the robbers who seemed to have been driving behind them struck. They got out of a huge BMW X5 carrying guns and they instructed everyone in the car to hand over their valuables, said our source.The source said after realising that one of the people that they had just robbed was Nathi of Nomvula fame, they decided to give it back to him. This is so annoying and inconveniencing. Can you imagine that you have just come back from a foreign country where you were treated like royalty and you get robbed in your own country as soon as you land? said the mole. Daily Sun.
