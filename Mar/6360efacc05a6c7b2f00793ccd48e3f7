Teargas, which then had three members, K.O, Ntukza and Ma-E, later released three other albums titled, Wafa Wafa (2008), Dark or Blue (2009) and Number Number (2012) (stylized as Num8er Num8er) which were all commercially successful. When he went solo, K.O released singles Mission Statement, Son of a Gun, Caracara and Skhanda Love preceding the release of his debut studio album, Skhanda Republic which was released in 2014.
