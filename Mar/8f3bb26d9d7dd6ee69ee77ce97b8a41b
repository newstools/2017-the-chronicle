Highlanders players celebrate their third goal during a Commander ZNA s Charities Shield match against FC Platinum held at Luveve Stadium in Bulawayo on SundayRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FC Platinum got a wake-up call from Highlanders on Sunday, with their coach Norman Mapeza admitting that his side needs to get their act together if they are to challenge for the title this season. Mapeza said they need to work on their defending frailties after Highlanders exposed them in a 3-0 routing in the semi-final of the Commander ZNA s Charities Shield match played at Luveve Stadium. This was a good game of football and for us it s still work in progress. They played better than us and we didn t defend well as we stayed too wide apart at the back, but on the positive side, I believe it s better to play such opposition like Highlanders because it gives us an opportunity to work on our defending. In two weeks time we should be good, Mapeza said.FC Platinum had Kevin Moyo partnering Gift Bello in central defence, with Ian Nekati deployed on the right side of defence, while new signing William Stima played as a left-back.Bosso drew first blood in the 13th minute through a volley by Simon Munawa, who connected Honest Moyo s cross from the left following a swift counter-attack that wrong-footed FC Platinum goalkeeper Petros Mhari.FC Platinum defenders struggled to contain new Bosso striker Rodrick Mutuma and his partner Prince Dube. Their partnership produced two goals that were both converted by Dube.Mutuma played as Highlanders target man, drawing FC Platinum central defenders out of position most of the time, leaving Dube and others to exploit the gaps.The ambitious Zvishavane side was again caught on the counter in the 44th minute. Mutuma cleverly set up Dube, who outpaced the FC Platinum s central defensive pair of Bello and Moyo before rounding up Mhari to score.Mutuma returned to haunt them in the 62nd minute by breaking loose on the left side to meet a through pass from substitute Brian Banda.He charged at the FC Platinum goal and instead of going all the way, he laid the ball onto the path of Dube for a simple tap in.Highlanders coach Erol Akbay said his game plan was to let FC Platinum come at them and get the visitors on counter attacks as he knew that their opponents left too much space at the back.On paper, FC Platinum have a strong squad and how they gel and combine will be key in their quest for the league title.Besides working on their defence, Mapeza needs to come up with a plan that will see his players laying siege on the opponents goal area.Against Bosso, FC Platinum failed to trouble goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda, whose involvement in the game was largely to start goal kicks.The Zvishavane side beefed up their squad with the quartet of Bret Amidu, Gift Mbweti, Talent Chawapiwa and Agrippa Murimba. These all featured against Highlanders.Amidu was full of running in midfield where he won a number of duels, while striker Mbweti was tightly marked, forcing him to drop into midfield in search of the ball.Murimba and Chawapiwa came in the second half, but hardly bothered Highlanders as FC Platinum continued to enjoy ball possession in harmless areas. In terms of endurance we re there, but we need to work on our processional play. We have to be able to use our possession to our advantage, Mapeza said.@ZililoR
