Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter TWO Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) employees appeared in court yesterday for allegedly defrauding their employer of $5 000 after making fictitious advance salary payment for leave days of a late workmate. Malapela Garayi Mukwena (54), a cashier at Zinwa offices in Beitbridge and Freedom Khumalo (54) who is an accountant based at the company s Bulawayo office appeared before Magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove facing fraud charges.They were remanded out of custody to April 21 on $100 bail each for continuation of trial.Prosecuting, Mr Kudakwashe Jaravaza said on October 31, 2014, the duo connived to defraud Zinwa by processing cash journals of Mukwena s staff advance salary deductions of $3 461, which was to be paid under the guise that it was for leave days for the late Derrick Gwizo.The court heard that the two men made a fictitious payment of salary advances for Mukwena in the process defrauding Zinwa of $3 461.The cash journals had no supporting documents or authorisation from the catchment or finance manager.The court heard that between March 1, 2011 and February 1, 2015, Mukwena received $1 581 from consumers which he was supposed to deposit into the Zinwa account.Mukwena took the deposit slips to Khumalo who was supposed to process and cash the receipts into the Zinwa s billing accounting system. The two accused persons connived to defraud Zinwa and Khumalo processed cash receipts into the company s billing account system of cash amounting to $1 581 to consumer accounts without deposit slips as proof, said Mr Jaravaza.An audit was carried out on March 31 last year leading to the discovery of the offences. A report was made to the police leading to the two men s arrest.Mukwena through his lawyers, Tererai Legal Practice, denied capturing salaries, arguing that he has no access to the system making it impossible for him to deduct anyone s salary. At all material time during the course of my employment once I received any cash I would forward it to the Bulawayo office and I cannot account for how it was disbursed, he said.Khumalo who is being represented by Phulu and Ncube Legal Practitioners said he did not misrepresent his employer. He argued that the money that he is purported to have stolen from the company was used to cover accommodation and travel expenses for a water quality workshop conducted in Beitbridge. @mashnets
