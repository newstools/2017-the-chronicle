Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter IN what will be a first in Zimbabwean football, Caps United have handed a five-game ban to a hooligan who was spotted urinating at the terraces during the club s Caf Champions League second leg match against TP Mazembe at the National Sports Stadium last Sunday. Givemore Mukozho of Glen View in Harare, believed to be a teacher, was caught on camera unashamedly urinating on the terraces during the match and the scene has since gone viral, much to the chagrin of the club bosses who immediately tasked its supporters association to hunt down the wayward fan. Caps United is a brand and we don t want to be associated with such behaviour. We used our structures in Harare to hunt down that guy, who is popularly known as Chitova within the Caps United family. We discovered that he is a resident of Glen View suburb and we have since handed him a five match ban from all our matches, said the Caps United national supporters chairman Blessing Gumbo.He said the ban must stand as a stern warning to like minded supporters who like to take advantage of peer pressure to tarnish the club s name. Clubs lose a lot of money through fines because of such people. Football is supposed to be a family sport but when an adult urinates in public then surely it can t be a family sport anymore. All like minded persons must take this as a serious warning, said Gumbo.Caps United clash with Highlanders in ZNA Commander s Charities final at Barbourfields Stadium this afternoon and Gumbo took the opportunity to urge club supporters to accept whatever outcome and desist from violence. If we win, which we hope to, let s celebrate in a non-provocative manner because we are one family with Highlanders but again if we lose let us accept the outcome, he said.&nbsp;
