Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter THE National Blood Services of Zimbabwe (NBSZ) has urged adults to donate blood following a trend that has seen them benefiting from 80 percent of the blood donated by school going children. NBSZ Matabeleland region public relations officer Mr Sifundo Ngwenya said the blood bank was bound to be affected by the introduction of the new curriculum which increased the number of activities that children have to participate in on a daily basis, hence adults have to play their part. The blood we have in our bank comes mainly from school going children but 80 percent of it is needed and used by adults. We therefore call on members of the public to come forward and give blood to secure their future health, said Mr Ngwenya. We are grateful to the Seventh- Day Adventist Church which partnered with us and helped source about 167 pints of blood during this past weekend. They helped us meet adults who for many years have been reluctant to donate blood which they need more compared to youths. He said the SDA youth programme had also helped the organisation to find regular donors which they had lost contact with. We had to turn away some potential donors as we could not keep up with the numbers. In the process of registering them, we discovered some were regular donors whom we lost when they left school, he said.@thamamoe
