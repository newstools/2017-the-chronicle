Mr Dan MoyoSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter RETIRED Bulawayo provincial education director Dan Moyo said he will not turn his back on sport and will always be available to serve the province whenever called upon. Moyo retired as provincial education director on Tuesday after 42 years of dedicated service to the education sector.He also had particular interest in grassroots sport development. I will never retire from sports, that I can assure you, said Moyo on the sidelines of his farewell party on Wednesday organised by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.Moyo said he was an athlete in his youth and as such sport remains in his blood. I wish really I could get even more and more involved in sport and I hope I will get that. I know there are Bulawayo provincial athletics competitions coming up now and I wish I will be invited too because that is my love, said Moyo.Moyo took sport seriously and rarely missed a sporting function whenever invited.He also spearheaded the introduction of a $2 sports levy in Bulawayo aimed at helping develop grassroots sport in the province. Not every child is academically gifted; that is a fact, so if we allow those children to pursue a career in sport, that can make a difference. We need to train these youngsters while still at school and I hope such programmes will continue, he said. Whoever takes over from me must develop further what has already been started. Let s take sport seriously and support our schools in their sporting endeavours. @skhumoyo2000.
