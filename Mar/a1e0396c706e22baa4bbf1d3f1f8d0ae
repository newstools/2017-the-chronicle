Minister Joram GumboThandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter THE Government is working on fixing roads, clinics and bridges destroyed by heavy rains within the next six months. The Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Dr Joram Gumbo, told Senators on Thursday that his Ministry had set up a committee which is currently working on sourcing funds to repair all roads which are in a bad state. We are now getting some money which is being mobilised through UNDP and other agencies; and through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development working together with the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC), said Dr Gumbo. We have given ourselves a timetable to say there are some areas that need urgent attention, like washed away bridges and some roads which are now not passable. We need to work on those roads within 30 days and others within 130 and 180 days and at most to have completed those roads within six months. He said the situation was worse in rural areas because the roads have been swept away. We are addressing that situation right now and the damage caused by cyclone Dineo will be a blessing in disguise for places like Binga. Ordinarily, we would not have been able to get funds to quickly move, assist or rehabilitate those roads, Dr Gumbo said while responding to questions from Senators. Now, we are going begging and I think the begging will assist us get the money to rehabilitate the Binga Kamativi Road and others. I have been there, so I know what you are talking about. @thamamoe.&nbsp;
