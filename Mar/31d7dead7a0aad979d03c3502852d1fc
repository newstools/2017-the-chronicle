On Saturday, entertainment at the bar will be spiced up by sought-after tribal house trio Djembe Monks.Rejoice Mafukidze, the Shisha Bar proprietor, said she had opened the spot to revive local jazz music. Vintage Bar has been rebranded and will be specialising in jazz music. Our style is to honour the mature jazz lover and host them in a tranquil space that appeals to the older urbanite. The bar will certainly change the way live music is consumed in Bulawayo, said Mafukidze. We revamped the place and put in new, eye catching designs that are both vintage and contemporary. She said they would keep the feel of the bar (Exchange) that was opened in the 1900s. With this bar, we want to highlight how it used to be back in the 1900s and what it is now. We ve preserved its historical outlook with a dash of modern designs and service. Patrons and musicians will certainly be awestruck with what Vintage Shisha Bar has to offer. The proprietor revealed plans to host veteran jazzman, Tanga wekwaSando later this month.Vintage Shisha Bar is the second pub of its kind to open in Bulawayo after Backroom Shisa in Bradfield.
