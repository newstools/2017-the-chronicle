Tobias Mandoreba, Hwange Correspondent MWACHEPA Netball Club will this year participate in the Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Netball League after five teams from the coal mining town agreed to form one strong team. Their main aim is to eventually qualify to join the Zimbabwe Netball Association Super League in the near future.Colliery, Lusumbami Queens and ZPC Hwange withdrew from the Super League end of 2015 due to financial constraints and fell under Matabeleland Netball Association (Mana) league, a move which proved detrimental to the girl child s exposure in the game, according to the Mwachepa team chairperson Precious Ndlovu. As administrators with a passion to see the girls go far in the sport, we have rescinded the decision to be part of the Mana league as their challenges to affiliate with the mother body deprived gifted players of chances to get exposure at the highest level like national teams.We have now formed a single team with other players coming from Lusumbami Queens, ZPC Hwange, Madumabisa Queens, Makwika Sisters and Cinderella but the ultimate goal is participation in the elite league to bring back the glory to the sport in this town. said Ndlovu.She said she was confident they will beat the March 29 deadline to pay the $160 registration fees.She said former netball national team coach Jabulani JB Phiri will coach the team. We will ensure we register before the deadline and we will also engage corporate sponsors for assistance especially on away matches. Having Phiri as coach is a blessing as he will mould the girls into stars. she said.Lusumbami Queens founder Thembinkosi Muremba, now secretary general in the new set up, said he is happy to participate in the more competitive Bulawayo league.Mana chairperson Soneni Ratsakatika, believed to be in South Africa, did not respond to questions sent to her on this latest move by local clubs.The club will participate at the season opener play offs at Sobukhazi High School today.They have also lined up a number of funding activities which include providing catering services, cleaning and operating a kiosk.&nbsp;
