Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU received a major boost ahead of their opening Castle Lager Premiership encounter against Triangle at Ascot Stadium on Saturday after sealing a sponsorship package with BancABC. The airmen become the third side to be bankrolled by the financial institution after Bulawayo giants Highlanders and former champions Dynamos.The union was solemnised on Tuesday and the sponsorship package will cater for the club s major expenses such as winning bonuses and travelling expenses.Chapungu chairman Hillary Jona confirmed the deal to Chronicle Sport saying the Chapungu playing kit will also be unveiled today when the club hosts a braai for its major stakeholders at Thornhill Sports Club.He, however, would not reveal how much the sponsorship package is worth. I am pleased that we have managed to retain BancABC as our major sponsor for the 2017 season. The sponsor will cater for most of our needs, which include winning bonuses, camping and travelling expenses, among others. We are indebted to the sponsorship as this will make our life easier and this will ensure that the club channels its energies to the field of play where we anticipate positive results this year, said Jona. In light of the sponsorship package, we will also be unveiling the playing kit for this season tomorrow during a braai where we are inviting our major stakeholders. The informal engagement is to ensure that we have the same vision as we take on the new season. Apart from the BancABC sponsorship, Jona said they are finalising other sponsorship packages with corporates as well as other prominent Gweru businessmen.Chapungu finished 13th last season and were in the middle of a promotion/relegation storm pitting PSL and Zifa.The club has since roped in former Shabanie Mine coach Tendai Chikuni, who has assembled a side he believes will hold its own this season.Chikuni brought back some former Chapungu players that had been loaned to sister clubs, among them striker Brighton Mugoni, who was at Blue Swallows last season.Zifa Central Soccer League Soccer Star of the Year Ricky Bota, Livingstone Genti, Lloyd Gwerina, Blessing Sahondo, Kelvin Bingala, Raymond Sibanda and Nigel Papius are some of the new faces in the Chapungu dressing room.Away from the pitch, Chapungu have also embarked on a major supporters recruitment drive and other initiatives, as the club tries to identify itself with the community and improve attendances at Ascot Stadium.@lavuzigara1
