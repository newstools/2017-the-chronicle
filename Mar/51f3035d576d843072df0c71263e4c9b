Dr Obert MpofuTHE Government is concerned with the lack of coordination in the manner in which the country is receiving investors, a Cabinet Minister has said. Macro-Economic Planning and Investment Promotion Minister Dr Obert Mpofu said this when he announced a new board for the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA).Minister Mpofu said the new team was expected to co-ordinate investors. The new board will ensure that all investors come through ZIA and the One-Stop-Shop Investment Centre for licensing and facilitation. This is one of the fundamental objectives of the new board to ensure that we handle our investors in a coordinated manner and I call on all ministries to co-operate with the new board, he said.Banker Mr Richard Victor Wilde chairs the board and is deputised by Dr Nomathemba Ndiweni. The new board takes over from the one that was chaired by former banker and businessman Dr Nigel Chanakira.Other board members include Jocelyn Mahachi, Florence Makombe, Nkosana Mkandla, Respina Zinyanduko, Clemence Masango, Chipo Mhini and Takabvakure Euwitt Mutunhu.Mr Wilde pledged to seek new investors as well as nurture those already operating in the country. I think it is also important that apart from facilitating new investment, we need to look after investment, which is already here. There is a lot of new investment that comes from existing investors and I think we need to focus on that, he said.The Government remains committed to creating an enabling doing business environment on which investments should thrive.
