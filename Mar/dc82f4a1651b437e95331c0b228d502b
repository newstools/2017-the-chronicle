Host province Matabeleland South and Bulawayo commanders have vowed to run away with the title.The two provinces, as well as Matabeleland North, will compete in seven disciplines, starting with today s indoor games that include chess, darts and pool, while athletics, netball, volleyball and football have been slotted for tomorrow. We are ready and not only that, we want to justify our presence in Gwanda and we can only do that by coming back as champions. We are intent on wresting gold won by Matabeleland South in men s soccer, chess and netball last year, said District Criminal Investigations Officer for Bulawayo Chief Superintendent Naison Hambira, who is also a renowned darts player, but is nursing an injury. I will not take chances lest I aggravate the injury, but the guys have been practising well. We had three friendly matches with top sides like Archers and Highlanders, which I think gave the guys a lesson or two, said Hambira.His Matabeleland South counterpart Chief Superintendent Max Maqandi said they were going to make full use of their home turf to grab every medal on offer. This is our home and we have to defend it by all means necessary. Our aim is to be ruthless hosts by grabbing every trophy. However, in terms of hospitality, we are ready for our visitors. Everything has been arranged for them and I hope they will enjoy their stay here, Maqandi said.The games will culminate in the selection of a national squad that will represent Zimbabwe at the Southern African Police Chiefs Co-operations Organisation Games (SARPPCO) in which Zimbabwe have been dominant since inception of the regional games. @skhumoyo2000&nbsp;
