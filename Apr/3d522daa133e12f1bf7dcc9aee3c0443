John NyikadzinoLovemore Zigara in Gweru NICHRUT finally struck the right chord to edge Makusha 1 0 in a Central Soccer League Shurugwi derby to claim the mining town s bragging rights. The game attracted a full house at Makusha Grounds where Kudakwashe Sibanda s 23rd minute strike settled matters.Nichrut coach John Nyikadzino dedicated the victory to club president Nicholas Gara and said they would build their campaign on it. We had to win the match at all costs, especially after a shaky start. I am happy the boys responded well and this win goes to our club president for the dedication and support he has given the club, said Nyikadzino. We are building from the win so that we meet our objectives at the end of the season, which is a top four finish. At the moment it is too early for us to talk about the championship considering the number of games we still have to play. I will only talk about it at the end of the season. The victory saw Nichrut climbing to eighth on the log standings with five points, five adrift of table toppers MSU, who maintained their lead after dismissing Angirai Chapo s Vumbachikwe 3 1 at the university campus on Saturday.Elsewhere, Tongogara maintained their unbeaten run after beating Blanket Mine 1 0 at Blanket Mine.The win by the army side saw them powering to second on the table and maintaining their 100 percent record.The loss by Blanket saw their three match unbeaten run coming to an abrupt end.ResultsIvan Hoe 2 0 FC Platinum U19, ZRP Gwanda 3 2 Kwekwe Stars, Makusha 0 1 Nichrut, Telone 0 1 Whawha, MSU 3 1 Vumbachikwe, Chrome Stars 3 0 Silo United, Blanket Mine 0 1 Tongogara, Gwanda United 0 0 Black Eagles, ZPC Munyati 1 0 Border Strikers.@lavuzigara1
