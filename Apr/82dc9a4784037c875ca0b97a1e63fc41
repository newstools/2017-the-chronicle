Clement MagwazaNhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent CLEMENT Magwaza of the makokotsha fame says musicians should desist from blaming radio stations for not playing their music as there are now a lot of diverse radio stations which are constantly seeking new material. Magwaza, who performed alongside Alick Macheso last weekend in Bulawayo, praised local radio stations, especially Skyz Metro FM for playing his music.He said the station, which is not even a year old, had changed the game as it is promoting Bulawayo talent, always calling on up-and-coming artistes to submit their music to them for airplay. The good thing is that there re now a lot of radio stations which are always calling out artistes to submit their music for consideration for airplay. As a serious musician, if you don t take your music to these radio stations, then the problem starts with you. It s pointless to blame radio stations, said Magwaza.He said most of the new stations in Bulawayo, Zvishavane, Gweru, Mutare, Masvingo and Kariba had even gone an extra mile to come up with programmes specifically aimed at exposing new and underrated artistes.Magwaza said artistes should however, not only rely on radio stations to promote their music as the coming in of new media has made it easier for one to put their work out there. Back then, we knew that if you didn t get airplay on radio, you d be invisible in the arts sector. But now in this digital age, you ll discover that those who re promoting their works on the Internet are very popular than those with music being played on radio. Artistes should therefore take advantage of digital platforms to promote their music. Artistes like DJ Ace Kater of the Izankaleli fame and comedians, Madam Boss and Mai Titi as well as producers of the Bulawayo Show are some of the people who have benefited immensely from using digital platforms like Facebook and YouTube to push their works while some are still struggling to make an impact.
