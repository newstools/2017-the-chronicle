Lovemore Zigara in Gweru MIDLANDS State University (MSU) FC received a shot in the arm ahead of the start of the 2017 Zifa Central Soccer League when a local medical aid institution donated a kit to the side. Bon Vie Medical Aid Services donated the kit on Wednesday at the university campus.MSU manager Herbert Masukume said the donation would go a long way in motivating his side to perform better this season. On behalf of MSU, I want to extend my gratitude to the donation made by Bon Vie Medical Aid Services and their donation will go a long way in motivating the team. We have set ourselves a target of gaining promotion into the topflight league and for us knowing that there are people that want to see us succeed is a big motivating factor, said Masukume.Bon Vie Medical Aid Services business development manager Innocent Muchivenyika said they were delighted to partner with the students and wished them luck ahead of the new season, which kicks off tomorrow.The donation came after a major shake-up of the MSU executive and technical department following an indifferent 2016 season in which the club had made huge investments with the hope of gaining promotion to the PSL.A new executive led by Tafirenyika Shoko was ushered into office following the dissolution of the Tinomuda Muzikamwi-led executive. Muzikamwi was, however, retained in the new set up as vice-chairman.There were changes to the technical department following the sacking of John Phiri, who was replaced by Themba Chingwena.Last season MSU managed to collect 50 points but were 19 points adrift of the winners at the end of the season in sixth position.This was disappointing considering that the varsity side had splashed money in acquiring players with Premiership experience such as former Hwange attacking linkman, Richard Jongwe, the Shabanie Mine quartet of Smart Muchabaiwa, Hamilton Masumbuko, Talbort Mthombeni and Farai Mususunye.- lavuzigara1.
