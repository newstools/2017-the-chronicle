The Harare derby pitting Dynamos and league champions Caps United at the National Sports Stadium (NSS) will feature Cyclone and Mufakose Queens, while New Orleans and Borrow Jets will lock horns ahead of the Highlanders FC and FC Platinum clash at Barbourfields Stadium.Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) vice-president Samukeliso Silengane said they are grateful for the opportunity to showcase women s talent. We appreciate the opportunity as women because we have been wishing for this for a long time. This comes as a way of promoting women s football by Zifa and it s good for our league. Our aim is to bring back the glory days of women s soccer, said Silengane.However, due to a tight Independence Day celebrations schedule, Silengane said there is no final match for the women s teams.The Independence Cup is an invitational tournament where participants are selected at the organisers discretion.With the winners in the men s category playing in the final on April 18 as part of the country s Independence celebrations at the National Sports Stadium, the third place play-off will be played at Barbourfields Stadium on the same day.While fans will pay to watch the semi-final clashes, the final will be free of charge.- @khumzallen
