Lovemore Zigara in Gweru THE Zimbabwe Wrestling Federation (ZWF) will attend a strategic workshop in Morocco tomorrow which will, among other things, seek to monitor progress on the United World Wrestling (UWW) strategic plan adopted in 2013. The workshop will run concurrently with UWW Africa congress where elections to choose a new executive to run the affairs of Africa will be elected as well as the African Championships. ZWF has thrown its weight behind incumbent Foud Maskout, who is also president of the Royal Moroccan Wrestling Federation.Zimbabwe will, however, not be represented during the African Championships as the country failed to secure air tickets for its wrestlers.ZWF secretary-general Tapiwa Masinire said the workshop will also explore how national wrestling federations can be assisted in terms of funding to grow the sport. The workshop will be an opportunity for national associations to bring to the fore the challenges they are facing so that they get funding. UWW has put new guidelines on how associations can access grants for developmental purposes, said Masinire. There will also be deliberations and updates on the implementation of the UWW strategic plan, which came into force in 2013. There will be feedback reports from national associations on how far they have gone in implementing the strategic plan, he said.Masinire said local wrestlers who will miss out at the African Wrestling Chapmpionships will, however, get a chance to participate in the Palhavani World Championships to be held in Azerbaijani from May 17-24.Palhavani is an Iranian wrestling style, which was incorporated into UWW styles last year when the inaugural championships were held in Belarus.Three wrestlers, Tapiwa Mukoni, Admire Tagwirei and veteran Herbert Muriri, will represent the country at the championships.@lavuzigara1
