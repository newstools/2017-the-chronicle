Jah PrayzahFrom Walter Mswazie in Masvingo Jah Prayzah, real name Mukudzei Mukombe and his Third Generation group gave a mouth-watering display at Masvingo s Caravan Park on Friday night. Getting to the stage just before midnight after up and coming artistes and DJ Gauleza took care of the otherwise restless fans, the dreadlocked artiste demonstrated that he is still on top of his game when he churned out hit after hit for fans who braved the chilly weather.The fans warmed up to his latest offering Sendekera, a collaboration he did with South Africa s Mafikizolo. They danced and sang along, much to his delight.The leisure spot, which has become a favourite for most artistes, was overwhelmed by the fans whose numbers kept swelling towards dawn.He sang songs like Kumbumura Mhute, Tsviriyo, Mbembe and Watora Mari which sent the revellers haywire as they whistled with some jumping onto the stage in saluting their icon.However, it was Watora Mari, a song that has won international acclaim, which brought the house down that young ladies could be seeing jumping onto the dance floor in an attempt to dance with their favourite singer.Considering the difficult economic conditions which have had a negative effect on people s disposable incomes, the show was well attended, showing that the man is still on top of his game.@walterbmswazie3
