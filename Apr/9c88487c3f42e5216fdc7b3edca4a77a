Noel Munzabwa in Manzini, Swaziland FORMER Warriors assistant coach Saul Chaminuka has booked a place in a major cup final for Matsapha United a fortnight after winning the National First Division to secure a Premiership berth. Chaminuka s Matsapha charges brushed aside popular Premiership outfit Manzini Wanderers 2-0 in the semi-final of the SwaziBank Cup #Yelele played at a packed Somhlolo National Stadium on Sunday.Manzini Wanderers became the third Premiership outfit to drown at the Deep Blue Ocean, after the MTN National First Division champions elect beat Mbabane Swallows 2-1 and Manzini Sundowns 1-0 in this cup tournament.The SwaziBank Cup is equivalent to the Chibuku Super Cup in Zimbabwe and comes with a ticket to the African safari via Caf Confederation Cup.The SwaziBank Cup comes with a winners prize money of 1 million emalangeni (about $80 000), a converted trophy and a rare handshake with King Mswati III.Chaminuka is pumped up and determined to shake the monarch s hand by delivering the trophy to his Premiership-bound employers, just nine months after he took on the job. I relish shaking hands with the highest man in the mountain kingdom. Like I said after knocking out Mbabane Swallows, expectations grew from everyone around us that we can go all the way and probably win it and now we are a game away. In fact, I want to take this team to the Caf Confederation Cup, said Chaminuka. The agony from Gabon (with the Warriors) inspired me a lot. That s why I didn t give myself a break after the Africa Cup of Nations finals. Within three days of being knocked out, I came back to be with the Express Blue Train. Caf Confederation Cup here I come, he said.Army side Young Buffaloes stand between Matsapha United and glory in the SwaziBank Cup final.The last time a National First Division outfit lifted this trophy was in 2008 when Malanti Chiefs outwitted then Premiership giants Royal Leopard.@NoelMunzabwa
