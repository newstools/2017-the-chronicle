Tanaka Mrewa, Court Reporter A MAN from Nkulumane suburb in Bulawayo has been fined $100 for kicking a six months pregnant woman on the stomach leading to the victim suffering a miscarriage. Hillary Mbekwe (38) pleaded guilty to assaulting Ms Juliet Maphosa (27).Western Commonage Magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube sentenced Mbekwe to 90 days in jail wholly suspended on condition that he pays a fine of $100.Mbekwe told the court that he lost his temper after Ms Maphosa insulted him using unprintable words in reference to his manhood. Your Worship I didn t mean to hurt her. It s only that she insulted me about my manhood. I felt disrespected. She talked of my organ as if she had seen it before. I lost my temper and slapped her out of anger, I never kicked her, said Mbekwe.Mr Ncube warned Mbekwe of the dangers of taking the law into his own hands. It is not wise to take the law into your own hands. When you have an altercation with someone you need to engage the police or a third party to help you solve your problems, said the magistrate. You may deny having kicked her but how can a mere slap result in a miscarriage? The only reason why you have been spared a custodial sentence is because you are a first offender hence sending you to jail may turn you into a worse criminal, he said.Prosecuting, Ms Magret Takawira said on January 21 this year at 10AM, Mbekwe had an altercation with Ms Maphosa. Accused person went to complainant s place of residence. He accused her of getting him into trouble with the police. Accused kicked the complainant on her belly and slapped her several times in the face. Complainant went to Mpilo Hospital where a doctor confirmed that she had suffered a miscarriage due to the assault, she said.Mbekwe is set to appear in court today for an unrelated rape charge.@tannytkay
