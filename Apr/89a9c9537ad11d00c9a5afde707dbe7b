Mlamuli PhiriSports Reporter TSHOLOTSHO FC have no regrets about their shock relocation to the Matabeleland South border town of Beitbridge, saying they recorded a profit in their first league match of the 2017 season. The club has thanked the Beitbridge community and municipal authorities for welcoming and giving them a good sanctuary.Although only 475 fans paid their way into Dhulivadzimu Stadium for the opening encounter pitting Tsholotsho and Hwange, which ended 0-0, Iziqholo Zezhwane chairman Mlamuli Phiri said they made a profit after paying for the stadium, referees and police charges.They could only manage this while still in Bulawayo whenever they played Highlanders, Dynamos and Caps United, while the rest of their home games at White City Stadium were loss making.The club paid $143 to the town council for stadium hire, $860 to the match officials and about $300 to the police and still remained with some money in their coffers. The town authorities charge us 10 percent of the gross gate takings, compared to 20 percent in Bulawayo, which again is when we play Highlanders, but otherwise we used to pay a flat figure of about $700. So our move to Beitbridge was really worth it and we have no regrets whatsoever, said Phiri.With the players leaving for the border town on Thursday, Phiri said accommodation issues have not been a problem as yet, a suggestion that probably sponsors have come on board, while fuel costs are catered for by the club s partners.He thanked fans that paid to watch their opening game and said although the results didn t go their way following a draw, they were staying in Beitbridge. I really want to salute the fans for their support, especially in our first game where they really did not know us and I urge them to continue rallying behind Tsholotsho. Better results are going to come; that I can promise them. We are back again for our next home game against Yadah FC, Phiri said.
