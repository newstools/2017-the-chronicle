I first encountered him in the early 80s, said Brig Gen Tapfumaneyi. l knew him as we all progressed up the ranks. Our relationship was cemented in May last year as we were working together to establish our new ministry. His role was critical in that he was in charge of the welfare department. Our ministry s core function is to deliver welfare statutory benefits that are written in law to various categories of the veterans of the liberation struggle.He carried a huge responsibility on his shoulders. We have 34 000 war veterans, and close to 20 000 widows. We estimate that we have about 200 000 war collaborators and there are 20 000 non-combatant cadres, those who went to war but stayed in the refugee camps with no chance to get training and 20 000 war victims, we are looking after. Family spokesperson Dr Augustine Murozvi said they were devastated by the passing on of Brig Gen Murozvi whom he described as a person who believed in total commitment to national duty. He was our family pillar, a man who stood for the needs of his family and the country at large, he said. He was a man who believed in family unit and his life was an inspiration to all of us. He leaves a rich legacy of work ethic and love. We are in mourning and we are feeling excruciating pain, but we are grateful to the President and his entire leadership team for seeing it befitting to bestow the highest honour on our land to our brother and we are taking consolation in that.
