Talent Chawapihwa was given his marching orders for a second booking for simulation inside the box in the 55th minute.The second red card was flashed in the 80th minute when Caps United s Michell Mwenya fouled Hillary Bakacheza outside the box.FC Platinum grabbed the match s solitary goal in the 66th minute from the penalty spot when Murimba was brought down inside the box by Last Sithole.Stima stepped up and placed the ball on the right side of Caps United goalkeeper Muchambo, who got a little touch of the ball.FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza believes the win is a big boost for his charges. This was a good game and for us it s a big boost towards our next match. Some of these youngsters have not been playing and today they proved that they have what it takes. They really displayed some brilliant performances. One or two of these youngsters might even play in the next match against Bulawayo City, but that will depend on their performances in training, said Mapeza.Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe said his strategy coming into the match was to broaden his player base. It was a decent game, we just needed time to look at other players and I think I saw what I wanted to see. It was only fair to give others a chance and see how they will do. In future I will be able to make decisions based on today s game. The boys have been doing well lately so we just have to move on, Chitembwe said.@khumzallen
