Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter KUSILE Rural District Council has held a sponsored walk to raise more than $5 000 to repair a school that was damaged by floods resulting in pupils learning in the open. Masungamhala Primary School, in Sothani Ward, a Forestry Commission area, is run by the local authority and two of its classroom blocks were damaged by floods last year at a time repairs were long overdue.KRDC chief executive officer Mr Christopher Tshuma said last Thursday s sponsored walk was coordinated by a local woman from Jiba Jiba, Mrs Cathrine Gumbo who is based in United States.She donated $4 000 towards school repairs.Mr Tshuma said council provided 50 bags of cement and they hope repairs would be concluded before schools open for the second term next month. The walk was facilitated by a non-governmental organisation called Baobab Strong coordinated by a local woman based in USA. She donated $4 000 towards the project. Initially we wanted to raise $5 000 to complete at least a single classroom block and we will see how much we can make, said Mr Tshuma.He said part of the school infrastructure had been damaged before the floods that hit most parts of the country in February.Matabeleland North Provincial Education Director Mrs Boithatelo Mnguni said she was aware of the school s state. The community told us and we okayed the sponsored walk. The school is on the boundary with Tsholotsho and was affected by the floods that affected Tsholotsho but we can t say it was closed because pupils have been attending lessons although in an open space, she said.@ncubeleon
