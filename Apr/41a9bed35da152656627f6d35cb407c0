Minister KasukuwereFrom George Maponga in Masvingo THE Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial coordinating committee (PCC) has endorsed a decision by the ruling party in Mashonaland Central calling for the removal of national political commissar, Cde Saviour Kasukuwere from his post for trying to topple President Mugabe, among other charges. Besides Cde Kasukuwere, the Zanu-PF Masvingo PCC also recommended the demotion of Masvingo Urban legislator and deputy secretary for Transport and Welfare in the politburo Cde Daniel Shumba from his post for fanning divisions in the party in Masvingo.Also in the line of fire at yesterday s PCC meeting, held at the Masvingo Showgrounds, was provincial political commissar Cde Jappy Jaboon, who was suspended for creating parallel structures in the party in the province, among a litany of other charges.Speaking at the end of a PCC meeting attended by ruling party heavyweights in the province, among them politburo members Cdes Shuvai Mahofa and Lovemore Matuke together with Central Commitee members, Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial secretary for administration Cde Ailess Baloyi, said the revolutionary party in the province wanted Cde Kasukuwere sacked.Mashonaland Central set the ball rolling by endorsing Cde Kasukuwere s ouster after the province, together with Midlands, staged demonstrations against the embattled political commissar.Cde Baloyi said Masvingo fully supported the decision taken by Zanu-PF Mashonaland Central province and had written a petition to President Mugabe through the ruling party s secretary for administration Cde Ignatius Chombo, to have Cde Kasukuwere relieved of his duties in the politburo. We did not resolve to have him (Cde Kasukuwere) necessarily expelled from the party but we no longer want him to continue as the Zanu-PF political commissar. It s up to the national leadership to see what they can do with him, whether to redeploy him or what but we no longer want him to continue as political commissar, he said. The reason why we took the decision against Cde Kasukuwere is because of his plans to topple President Mugabe and also creating parallel structures and interfering in party activities even in lower levels of the party like districts. What he did was bad and caused a lot of problems in the party, he added.Cde Baloyi said as a province, Masvingo did not have the powers to suspend Cde Shumba who is a deputy secretary in the politburo. As for Cde Shumba, we are not saying the leadership should expel him. We do not enjoy having members expelled but we are saying he is no longer serving the party interests in the politburo and must be stripped of his position. (Cde) Shumba has been causing a lot of problems in the party because of his position in the politburo and we have recommended that he be withdrawn and become an ordinary card carrying party member, said Cde Baloyi.He said the ruling party s PCC suspended Cde Jaboon with immediate effect for causing chaos in the party through creation of parallel structures. We suspended Cde Jaboon today (yesterday) from his post pending his appearance before a disciplinary hearing and we have notified the national leadership of our decisions against him. Cde Jaboon is no longer the party s political commissar in Masvingo until disciplinary proceedings against him, said Cde Baloyi. Besides creating parallel structures, Cde Jaboon was no longer attending key party meetings and was also in the habit of harassing party members in the provincial executive whom he threatened with punitive action if they refused his love advances, he said.Cde Baloyi said Masvingo wanted unity to consolidate the party s electoral gains in the province.
