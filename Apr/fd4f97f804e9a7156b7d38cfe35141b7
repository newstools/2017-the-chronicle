Our busiest days this year were Good Friday and Easter Monday. On Friday we had the highest number of entries at 5 819 while we had the highest number of exits on Monday with 5 753, he said.Mr Marwa said travellers who passed through the border over the holiday comprised mostly of religious groups. He said operating for 24 hours each day over the Easter holiday helped to ease congestion.Mr Marwa said travellers however, faced delays at the Ramokgwebana Border Post in Botswana with some travellers being forced to turn back. All our systems were up and running throughout the Easter Holiday and all travellers were cleared on time and efficiently. We didn t receive any complaints from travellers although they faced challenges upon reaching the Botswana side. Some travellers were being forced to turn back while others resorted to using Maitengwe and Mphoengs Border Posts which are within the region, he said.The Plumtree Border Post introduced a 24 hour service over the Easter Holiday.@DubeMatutu
