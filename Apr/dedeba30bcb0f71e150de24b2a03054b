We have speakers that will address different topics we feel can help footballers develop their careers on and off the field, said Ndlovu.Among those that have been invited to make presentations are the police drugs section and anti-doping officials.Zifa Southern Region has also invited Matabeleland Aids Council, New Start Centre, banks, former players, Grassroots Soccer Zimbabwe, Footballers Union of Zimbabwe, and the Sports and Recreation Commission.Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe officials will also be on hand to give footballers tips on defensive driving and discourage participants from driving without a licence.A number of footballers have in the past found themselves on the wrong side of the law by driving without a licence.Mkhululi Mthunzi, a regional training and development administrator, said the programme will cascade to schools. We re planning on extending this initiative to primary and secondary schools, tertiary institutions and universities, as well as women s football.
