Business Reporter ECONET Wireless Zimbabwe has integrated its EcoSure and EcoCash services as part of measures to promote cashless transactions and give customers convenience through acceptability of mobile money payments to access funeral services. Econet assistant to the executive Mr Lovemore Nyatsine said the move has come in handy in easing demand for cash and promoting cashless transactions at a time when Zimbabwe is facing liquidity challenges.Using this facility Mr Nyatsine said customers were able to buy literally everything, from supermarkets, service stations, flea markets, fruit and vegetable informal markets through EcoCash merchants widely spread across the country.He said these measures were in tandem with the Government s vision of a cashless society and promoting ease of doing business. EcoSure has created a unique funeral services ecosystem with 15 prominent and reputable Funeral Service Providers (FSP) that serve bereaved families 24 hours a day. Did you know that EcoSure is assisting more than 400 families every week? said Mr Nyatsine. This ecosystem allows EcoSure customers access to over 100 funeral service centres throughout the country. There are other FSPs who are not directly contracted by EcoSure but also registered as Ecocash merchants and independently assist EcoSure bereaved families in the event that they receive funeral cash benefits via EcoCash. He said Econet s vision was to transform lives of customers through the use of technology hence the need for clients to embrace measures such as plastic money usage.Mr Nyatsine said this as he responded to concerns raised by EcoSure subscribers in Bulawayo who felt the giant telecommunications firm was shortchanging them through delays in releasing funds to beneficiaries upon bereavement.He insisted that having a funeral cover was affordable and convenient with EcoSure as customers were able to complete all the registration process via mobile phones. To register for EcoSure Funeral cover, all one needs is an active Econet line registered on EcoCash and be between the age of 18 and 70, he said.EcoSure monthly premiums start from as low as $0.50 (fifty cents) to $5 (five dollars) with guaranteed assured amount ranging from $500 to $5 000 depending on the plan assured, said Mr Nyatsine.He said all premium payments were done through EcoCash without the need for customers to visit banks or offices.Last year, Econet unveiled another first, a funeral package dubbed Thwala Sonke , which allows existing and potential policy holders to cover an unlimited number of immediate and extended family members directly from their mobile phones.Upon a claim, an EcoCash transfer from EcoSure into the bereaved families account is guaranteed within 24 hours, said Mr Nyatsine.
