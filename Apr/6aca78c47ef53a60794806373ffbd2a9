DJ SkaivaBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent DJ Skaiva believes the time has come for him to break new ground in the music industry. The DJ, who is preparing to launch his debut album Against All Odds at Groove Night Club on Saturday, has already given people snippets of what is in store for them through Imali Yeqolo , a track he has been playing a lot at various spots.Other songs to look forward to include Singajindi featuring Lillian, SaGumbo, Power featuring Juandez Apongo and Shingirira featuring Joel.DJ Skaiva described his album as a testimony of the hardships that he went through in his career. I ve been discouraged, laughed at and ridiculed but I didn t give up, something I tried expressing through music on the album. I want people to get to know me better and experience house music the way I see it, said DJ Skaiva. The Zimbabwe Music Award winner said: It s time for me to prove my mettle. I know someone somewhere will like the album or some of the tracks enough to buy them and also make them club bangers. Taking notes from Sandra Ndebele, Skaiva plans to promote the album to the rest of the country by embarking on a national tour. Just like Sandra Ndebele who s been going around the country promoting her single Ingoma, I ll be doing the same for this album. I hope to take it to Gweru, Harare, Mutare and Victoria Falls among other areas where I ll be performing. I m feeling a bit nervous because tours are very tricky as one will be performing for a completely new audience, but at the same time, I m happy that my first album is coming out. He said he was looking for innovative ways to sell copies of the album through social media. Contact details on how people can buy my album are on my Facebook page and I m still thinking of how I can push sales online, said the DJ. DJ Skaiva has produced tracks such as Godobori, Sweet Jesus (which was nominated twice at the Metro FM 2014 awards), It s Love, Cal Vin s Fronto and Thando by Cr me Voices.@bonganinkunzi
