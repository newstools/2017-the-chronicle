Cde Abednico NcubeNqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Government has urged rural district councils (RDCs) to prioritise clearing workers salary arrears and service delivery before awarding packages to councillors. Addressing RDCs representatives in Bulawayo on Thursday, the Minister of Rural Development, Promotion and Preservation of National Culture and Heritage, Cde Abednigo Ncube, said councils should comply with the Government s 30:70 salary to service delivery ratio directive.He made the remarks after it emerged that some councils were proposing to purchase vehicles and motorbikes for councillors. The 30:70 service delivery to recurrent expenditure ratio should always be taken into cognisance when executing your duties as local authorities. This ratio should be adhered to both in letter and spirit. Some councils have circumvented this directive by continuing to prioritise other administrative commitments at the expense of service delivery, he said.Cde Ncube said councils should also ensure that workers are paid their salaries before council awards packages to councillors. I urge councils not to abuse funds by purchasing motorbikes without the approval of the Ministry. I expect you to clear salary arrears on 30:70 ratio, purchase the council s chairman s vehicle then apply to purchase of motorcycles in that order.Accordingly, all local authorities with salary arrears should clear the backlog prior to applying for such benefits, said Cde Ncube.He said RDC s should come up with strategies of dealing with illegal settlements and provide residential stands to youths. It is not fair to expect your youths to get stands from urban local authorities who have oversubscribed waiting lists. It is abnormal for a parent to look after the welfare of a neighbour s child while his own child is starving, the Minister said.Cde Ncube encouraged RDCs to avail industrial stands that would spearhead development in rural areas.He said to promote local investment, councils should increase their participation at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. @nqotshili&nbsp;
