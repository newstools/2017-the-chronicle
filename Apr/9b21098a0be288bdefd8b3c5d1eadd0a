Women should not come without objectives because it will be a waste of time. They must not wait for the ZITF to end, they must make use of it as it is designed for them, she said.Mrs Ndlovu said women could download the ZITF 2017 mobile application. Those who have got smartphones can download our mobile application. It is available on Google, App Store and it is free of charge. This mobile application is important in the sense that it has got all information about exhibitors who have booked now and the visitors who have registered online, she said.Mrs Ndlovu also told women that it may be difficult to use the traditional media platforms like television for adverts but they can promote their presence by using social media platforms. Let us use the social media to advertise ourselves and the products we produce as this has proved to be very cost effective, said Mrs Ndlovu.She said ZITF was not a platform to sell the products but it can be used for brand awareness.The training programme of exhibitors for ZITF was organised by the Ministry of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development and the four provinces which attended included Bulawayo Metropolitan, Matabeleland South, Matabeleland North and the Midlands.@Kiyaz_Cool
