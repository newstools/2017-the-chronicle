Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE headmaster of Sabiwa primary school at Vumbachikwe Mine in Gwanda, Marvellous Moyo, is facing charges of allegedly stealing a vehicle which he had sold to a fellow Gwanda resident. Moyo (42) who was scheduled to appear in court yesterday, had his case postponed to May 3.Charges against Moyo are that sometime in August 2015, he sold a Mazda 626 to Mr Celani Moyo for $1 400.Mr Celani Moyo then paid $1 000 with the agreement that the balance would be paid after they had sorted the issue of the vehicle s registration book.Moyo allegedly promised to bring the registration book in two weeks time and Mr Celani Moyo took delivery of the vehicle.After a month, Moyo went to Mr Celani Moyo s house at night and allegedly stole the vehicle.When Celani Moyo inquired from Moyo about the vehicle, he accepted that he was the one who had taken it as he wanted to check some information and promised to surrender it back.A few days later, Mr Celani Moyo was surprised to see his vehicle being driven by a stranger who said he bought the vehicle from Moyo, the state alleges.This prompted Mr Celani Moyo to make a police report leading to the arrest of Moyo.Police were initially charging Moyo with fraud for allegedly selling the same vehicle to two people.This was later changed to theft of motor vehicle following advice from the prosecutor s office.Mr Teererai Mahohoma is appearing for the state.@richardmuponde
