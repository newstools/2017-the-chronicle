On March 22 at around 6AM, the accused person acting in common purpose with his father Mexen Sibanda, who is still at large exerted illegitimate pressure on Julia Mbangwe. The accused person and his father went with the corpse of Mlungisi to Mbangwe s homestead claiming that her sons had caused the death of Mlungisi and as such demanded three cattle from the complainant before the burial of the deceased, said Ms Chipanga.The court heard that Ms Mbangwe gave them only one beast instead of the three they had demanded.She said that the accused person then left the deceased s body in the complainant s kitchen and went away.
