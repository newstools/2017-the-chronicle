South African DJ, Black Coffee says a collaboration with Usher Raymond fell through because the multi-award winning American artiste felt the song Coffee sent him was not African . During a recent interview with Metro FM, Black Coffee revealed that he almost worked with Usher while he was in New York. While I was in New York, I met up with Usher s manager, said the DJ. Obviously, [he said], let s work, let s work, we like the African vibe. I m like, Cool, let s do it. Black Coffee got on the phone with Usher, and told the R&amp;B star he had a song for him already. I sent the song, said Coffee.The next day, he got a response from Usher s manager saying: No, he thinks the song is a bit too modern, he wanted something African. I m like maybe not, said Black Coffee with a nonchalant shrug. I don t know what Africa is to him, but to me Africa is something different, we re not in the jungle right now, you know. Africa is different, Africa is a totally different place. For other people, they still want to hear the bongos and the congas, he continued. I m cool to do that, but only if it fits. For me if I want to do something with you, this is the vision I have, you know. So, the song might not happen because I m not African enough. Online.
