Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter EXCITING times lie ahead for women s football after Zifa undertook to sponsor a 16-team national Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League, whose kick-off has tentatively been pencilled for early next month. The national women s football league makes a return after a four-year absence.According to Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda, all participating teams will be kitted and given four footballs each, while transport and referees fees will also be taken care of by the national association. The women s Super League is back. Through funds we get as Zifa, we will pay for transport and referees fees, with teams only taking care of minor expenses like feeding their players. Fifa has an ambitious programme of promoting the girl child and as Zifa we are fulfilling that mandate as well, said Sibanda. We have managed to source uniforms worth about $110 000 for the teams, while $40 000 has been set aside for transport. Our concern though is that women don t seem eager to participate in administrative courses which are meant to empower them, but instead send men. We want women to run football clubs on their own. Bulawayo will have five teams in the league, old campaigners New Orleans, Inline Academy, Burrow Jets, Street Sets and recently rebranded Ubuntu FC from Cowdray Park.Indications are that Highlanders Royals might also join the elite league once they sort out in-house squabbles threatening to destroy the side.Zimbabwe Women s Football vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane welcomed the development, saying it was the first of many good things to come in women s football. It s a good jump start, we hope teams will give us quality competition and exercise professionalism in the running of the game. We can only encourage them to attend workshops because knowledge is power, said Silengane, whose committee now needs to find partners for cup tournaments and even league sponsorship.@skhumoyo2000
