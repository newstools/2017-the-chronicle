Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter THE family of a Grade Seven Bulawayo pupil is seeking funds from well-wishers to enable her to undergo a heart surgery. Princess Chikwakwa (15), a pupil at Mtshede Primary School in Njube suburb, was recently diagnosed with a heart problem and has another condition that occasionally collapses her pulmonary veins and arteries.A total of $6 000 is required for the operation at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare, but the family also needs some money for hospitalisation, travel and other incidentals.According to the girl s mother, Ms Caroline Chikwakwa, her daughter was born with the health complications, but was only recently diagnosed after multiple tests when she fell ill.Ms Chikwakwa said as a result of the problem, her daughter s studies have been disturbed and her growth has been stunted. The doctor has recommended an urgent heart surgery in two months time and the cost of operation is estimated at $6 000, she said.Ms Chikwakwa appealed for help from well-wishers to enable her daughter to undergo the operation.She said the family is praying that all goes well so that Princess writes her final Grade Seven public examinations later this year as she has failed to do so previously due to her condition. My daughter is always in and out of school. We took the matter seriously last month when I realised her head was swollen and she complained of a severe headache, said Princess mother.She said whenever her daughter falls sick, her heart pumps abnormally.Ms Chikwakwa said Princess is on medication pending an operation at the Harare hospital if they manage to raise the required funds. We do not have the money to pay for my daughter s surgery. She is under medical aid with Premier Service Medical Aid Society but they told us that her account has been exhausted since she has been in and out of hospital. She has been covered for the last seven years and all along we thought that PSMAS would foot the bill. We failed to get free treatment when Indian doctors came because they were fully booked. We hope that she gets better and is able to sit for her Grade Seven examinations, which she has failed to do previously due to ill health, she said.Well-wishers who wish to assist the family can contact them on 0716079 838 or 0772 417 281.Cash can also be deposited into Ms Caroline Chikwakwa s ZB Bank account number 4304469527200.@andile_tshuma
