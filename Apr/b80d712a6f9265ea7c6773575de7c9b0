Vendors operating outside a supermarket in GweruSharon Chiware, Midlands Reporter VENDORS are back at undesignated selling points in the Gweru Central Business District after defying a council order to relocate to Swift Vendor Mart in the light industrial area. Two weeks ago, the local authority launched a blitz to rid the CBD of illegal vendors but the vendors are now back on the pavements of leading retail outlets.The vendors who are involved in running battles with municipal police, are now selling their wares from either vehicles or pushcarts.Gweru Hawkers and Vendors Association representative Mr Arnold Shava said they would not comply with the council s order because the area that council wants them to operate from is far from their customers. The Swift Vendor Mart is far from the CBD where our customers are and there are no toilets, he said.Town Clerk, Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza said while council was not against vending, vendors should operate from designated points. We do not want vendors to operate from pavements of retail outlets as doing so is inconveniencing shoppers and also promotes disorderliness, she said.Ms Gwatipedza said vendors should pay some fee to council and this is only feasible if they operate from designated points.She said council will therefore continue to raid the illegal vendors until they comply with the order to move to Swift Vendor Mart. @sharonchiware1.
