You are aware, as I have communicated before, that your spokesperson, with the help of equally thuggish two members of the party from Harare province, has hired thugs to trail and harm me hence I see no point really to engage, every day, in fighting thugs rather than the Zanu-PF regime, reads part of his resignation letter sent to Dr Mujuru.The fight between Mr Mawarire and Mr Nyandoro was sparked by long-standing differences over NPP s position regarding the proposed opposition coalition which has seen MDC-T s Morgan Tsvangirai warming up to ZimPF, leaving NPP at sixes and sevens.More to follow&#8230;&nbsp;
