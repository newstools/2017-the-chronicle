Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter MORE women should be empowered to tap opportunities in the mining sector, which is largely dominated by men. Addressing students at a Career Fair 2017 at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) in Bulawayo last Wednesday, a senior executive at Mimosa Mining Company, Mrs Judith Mujakachi, challenged female students to take science subjects seriously in order for them to venture into mining and other technical fields.She said women should not be afraid to venture into mining as they have succeeded in other aspects of the economy. Today we encountered many female students asking about the career prospects at Mimosa. They must take their studies seriously especially in science related subjects so as to qualify in the sector, said Mrs Mujakachi. Also, women in the country should strive by all means to be in this sector because it is the one that the country benefits from. Mining is the cornerstone of the economy and women have a very big role to play in this economy. She said there was nothing unusual about women working underground except that society holds some stereotypes about certain careers.Nust career guidance and employment officer, Mr Charlie Ncube, said the career fair was an annual event that seeks to create a platform for students to interact with the world of business and to familiarise them with the business figures before they go on attachment and seek employment after graduating.Students interviewed by Business Chronicle said the event was an eye opener as this helped them to plan properly their career prospects. I learnt a lot from this event and it gave me a broader picture about what should I study when I finish my high school. It also makes me work hard at school in order to attain the cut off points needed for me to pursue this degree, said Nobuble Banda.This year s 4th edition of Career Fair saw over 20 companies exhibiting and the event was attended by local Nust and high school students. @Kiyaz_Cool
