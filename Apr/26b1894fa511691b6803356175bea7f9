Japhet Ncube of Mpugwi Village in Madlambuzi area was convicted on his own plea of guilty to unlawful cultivation of dagga by Plumtree magistrate, Mr Taurai Mawere.He was however sentenced to a wholly suspended 12 months jail term after the magistrate took the old man s advanced age into consideration. I wanted you to perform community service but there is no institution which is located close to your homestead. Sending you to prison isn t an option because you are an old man. Go back to your homestead and live like a responsible old man. Don t cultivate dagga anymore because if you do I will send you to prison. The dagga which was found has been forfeited to the State, said Mr Mawere as he passed his sentence.Prosecuting, Mrs Rose Sibanda said police detectives found the dagga in Ncube s garden on April 11.
