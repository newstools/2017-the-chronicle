Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIFA will hold a one-week Level 1 coaching clinic for Southern Region women at Raylton Sports Club in Bulawayo from April 22- 29. Former Mighty Warriors utility player Sithethelelwe Kwinji 15 Sibanda, who recently made history by becoming the first Zimbabwean woman to attain a Caf A coaching licence, will be among the facilitators.Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) vice-president Samukeliso Silengane challenged women to attend such programmes which are meant to empower them. This is a move by Zifa to ensure that women are not left out following a coaching course, which was mainly dominated by men in Bulawayo. The association decided to reduce the charges to $40 so that people can afford to pay for the course. We therefore call upon anyone from former players, teachers and even players interested in the technical knowledge of the game to come forward as this is an opportunity for us as women in football to empower ourselves. The clinic is not only limited to women, but anyone interested can attend, Silengane said.@khumzallen
