Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS FC in partnership with Sunset Marketing (Pvt) Ltd will soon launch its own brand of mealie-meal, Bosso Roller Meal, as the club looks to alternative revenue streams. The deal, which was unveiled at the club s weekly press conference in Bulawayo on Thursday, will see both parties sharing profits equally.Sunset Sales and Marketing manager Mufaro Msipa said they are packaging 10kgs bags for now but plans are underway to offer 5kg, 20kg and 50kgs soon. We are happy to be associated with Highlanders FC as we are proud supporters of the club. It is against this background that we have taken it upon ourselves to produce mealie-meal for the club. The mealie-meal is already there and we have about 500 tonnes in stock. We are already working on the supply chain like Choppies, TM and some of the local supermarkets around the city so that we can start distributing the product, said Msipa. We are trying to get to other bigger outlets around the country for people to get the mealie-meal. People will enjoy this mealie-meal because at Sunset Marketing we are all about quality products. We have just three years in the market and our key turning point is the quality of our mealie-meal .Highlanders club treasurer Donald Ndebele said the deal would help in funding projects and the club s outstanding debts. We will soon be launching the mealie-meal into the market so it s a partnership with Sunset Marketing. Highlanders will be getting 50 percent of the profits so that we can be able to fund some of our projects and write off some of our debts. This partnership will remain for an indefinite period as long as it s benefiting both parties, Ndebele said. @khumzallen&nbsp;
