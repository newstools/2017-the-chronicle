Chernee AttwellMashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter A BANK teller at MBCA Bank s Belmont branch in Bulawayo allegedly betrayed the trust bestowed on her by a friend when she withdrew $800 from two accounts and squandered the money. Chernee Attwell (27) of Morningside suburb in the city spent the money while her friend, Mr Theunnissen Rene Robin, was on holiday outside the country.Attwell, who has since lost her job at MBCA Bank as a result of the alleged offence, appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya facing two counts of theft of trust property.When Attwell initially appeared in court on Monday unrepresented, she had pleaded guilty to the charge, but on Thursday she altered her plea to not guilty acting on her lawyer s instruction.She was remanded out of custody to April 10.Mr Tashaya, who was not amused by Attwell s change of plea, had no kind words for her. It s best to pay back the money rather than wasting the court s time on trivial issues. I will give you up to Monday (April 10) to sort out issues with your client, he told Attwell s lawyer.Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said between October 28 and November 2 last year, Mr Robin was given permission by Mr Alexander Chitike and Mr Elliot Tinage, the owners of the two accounts, to withdraw money on their behalf.Mr Robin then went on holiday and gave Attwell the two bank cards to withdraw the money on his behalf.She withdrew $400 from each of the two bank accounts and converted the money to her own use. The accused withdrew a total of $800 from the two bank accounts and she converted the money to her personal use, said Mr Dlodlo.The court heard that when Mr Robin returned, Attwell failed to hand over the money and the matter was reported to the police, leading to her arrest.She is being represented by lawyers from Mashayamombe and Company. @mashnets
