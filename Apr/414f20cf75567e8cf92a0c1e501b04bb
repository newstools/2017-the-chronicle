Thulani SibandaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER champions, Bulawayo Chiefs will open their Southern Region Division One Soccer League account with a derby against Bosso 90 on April 15 at Barbourfields Stadium. Chiefs finished last season second on the table behind Bantu Rovers who beat them to the title on a superior goal difference.The near title miss was a bitter pill to swallow for the Chiefs family, with rumours flying out that the club was on the verge of collapse as their president and benefactor Lovemore Sibanda had not taken the loss well.However, Chiefs seem to have put behind their hideous end to the 2016 season, with their coach Thulani Sibanda who guided them to the 2013 title assembling what looks like a strong squad that can put a strong championship challenge.Veteran midfielder, Mthulisi Maphosa, has been given a lease of life at Chiefs and is expected to play a key leadership role in guiding the ambitious side to the title.Besides Maphosa, Chiefs coach Sibanda has also lured ex-Quelaton, Highlanders and ZRP Bulawayo utility player Patrick Mpofu, goalkeeper Josphat Sibanda formerly with Highlanders and Border Strikers, former Chicken Inn and Bulawayo City midfielder Makhosi Ncube and unheralded Musa Phiri who played for Chicken Inn s Division Two side last season.Joshua Wilson, a vital cog for Rovers title run is also at Chiefs and the club has reunited with attacking winger Tatenda Madzingo who spent the last half of 2016 trying his luck in Dubai.Chiefs coach, Sibanda has made a bold declaration that they are going for the title. Look, we re in this race to compete and win. It s every coach s dream to lead his side to a title, I m not different and I m not a pessimist. I know it won t be an easy walk in the park but I think we re on the right track, Sibanda said.Some of the teams expected to give Chiefs a good run for their money are ZPC Hwange, Talen Vision and Amagagasi.Southern Region Division One Soccer League fixturesWeek One, April 15: Black Boots v Casmyn (Fairbridge), Makomo v TBA, Bosso 90 v Bulawayo Chiefs (Barbourfields), ZPC Hwange v ZRP Bulawayo
