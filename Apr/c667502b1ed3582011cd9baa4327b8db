Girls enjoy at Hartsfield TshisanyamaShowbiz Reporter HARTSFIELD Tshisanyama in Bulawayo will be lit this weekend as the braai joint is encouraging people to team up, load their cooler boxes and make their way to the spot for an unforgettable experience. Normally, drinks from outside are not allowed into the venue, but for this weekend, patrons are being allowed to bring their preferred drinks to drink and be merry.Dubbed the Cooler Boxing day , the event today will feature a performance by SA-based DJ Zandi Maz who will be supported by resident DJs Ras Obido, Liz, Eugy, Wellyonz and Crazy Dee. Tomorrow, Victor Bravo takes over from Zandi.Mduduzi Mdlongwa, proprietor of the popular spot, said entrance to the venue has been pegged at $10 per vehicle or $2 per person. The entrance fee covers those in the car and the cooler box. If one doesn t have a cooler box, entrance will be $2 per person. Cooler boxes however, can only be brought from midday to 8PM, afterwards, they won t be allowed into the venue, said Mdlongwa. When the drinks in the cooler boxes are finished, people can only refill at the bar. We won t allow them to refill their cooler boxes outside. He said this weekend will be unique in that a trophy will be given to those who will have the best/hottest crew as well as a fancy cooler box. Over the years, we ve observed patrons and one thing we ve noticed is that people usually come as a group. So, we decided to encourage this by awarding those who ll visibly be enjoying with their friends/colleagues as we prepare for the Easter holiday, Mdlongwa said.After the outing tonight, an after-party has been arranged at Club Eden. People who ll be at the outing on Saturday will be given tags which they can use to gain entry into Club Eden for the after-party, said Mdlongwa.&nbsp;
