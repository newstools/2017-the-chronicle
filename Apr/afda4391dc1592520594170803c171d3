Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange THE Matabeleland North Provincial Pool Association (MNPPA) held provincial qualifiers for national team selection at the Tennis Club on Saturday, with Hwange s GK Snipers Club cueist Christopher Musopero emerging overall winner. Musopero and runner-up Tonderai Mugagami of Ingagula Pool Club will represent Matabeleland North at the national team trials on May 12 in Harare hoping to make the grade.Three districts, Hwange with nine players, Binga (eight) and Lupane (eight) took part in the qualifiers following district selection games held a fortnight ago.The games were played in a best of three frames format and Musopero got the better of Lovejoy Makope in the first round, Humphrey Riyano in the second round, Sibangani Silwangani in the quarter-finals and Kwanisai Siyanjeme in the semi-finals.Mugagami beat Regerayi Mtetwa in the opening round, Client Hwanda in the second round, Munyaradzi Hakulandaba in the quarter-finals and Nicholas Ndiyamba in the semis.An elated Musopero is confident of making the national team grade in Harare next month. I am happy to have been the overall winner. I m confident I ll make it into the national team. I get my strategy from studying my opponents and my white ball management gives me the edge. The turnout shows that the popularity of pool is rising and I hope the sport will also be well followed and sponsored like football, said the dreadlocked Musopero.In the ladies category, Itai Dube (Hwange) and Mary Ndlovu (Lupane) will represent the province in Harare.MNPPA president Humphrey Riyano is happy with the progress of the game in the province following the formation of the first Hwange League at the beginning of last month. The growth of pool is amazing since we now have three running leagues in a space of two months and we hope to get resources to ensure all eight districts in the province have running leagues by end of the year, Riyano said.@tobymandox
