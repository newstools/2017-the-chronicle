Cde Nomthandazo Eunice MoyoNduduzo Tshuma, Political Editor THE Zanu-PF Bulawayo provincial women s league yesterday called for the sacking of party national political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere and the recall of Bulawayo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Cde Nomthandazo Eunice Moyo from Parliament. In a meeting at the Davies Hall, provincial party offices, the women s league accused Cde Kasukuwere of creating parallel structures, fanning factionalism and arbitrary expulsion of party members.On Cde Moyo, the organ said, since she resigned from the women s league which was the basis of her appointment to Parliament under the women s quota, she can no longer continue as MP.Addressing the meeting, the provincial women s league chairperson Cde Eva Bitu said by resigning from the women s league, Cde Moyo had admitted to the allegations levelled against her. She (Cde Moyo) resigned from the politburo which means she is no longer a Politburo and Central Committee member but an ordinary member. When you resign from a position because you have been accused of committing crime, in our culture it means you are admitting to those charges, she said.Cde Bitu said after Cde Moyo s resignation, Central Committee member and Zanu-PF national executive member Cde Judith Ncube was now the most senior in the women structures of the province.She said Cde Moyo s Parliamentary seat should be declared vacant following her resignation as Deputy Secretary for the women s league. We declare today that we are behind President Mugabe and we don t want to hear about the so-called Lacoste or G40 factions, we say down with them and as the women s league we are fully behind President Mugabe, said Cde Bitu.She said many members had been hounded out of the party over accusations of belonging to either Lacoste or G40 factions.Cde Ncube said divisions caused by Cde Moyo in Bulawayo had impacted negatively on the mobilisation of members ahead of next year s elections.She said they bowed their heads in shame at the recent meeting of the Central Committee when it was revealed that Bulawayo had only managed to create 1 000 cells compared to other provinces with as many as 15 000 cells.She said the province only managed to raise a paltry $5 000 for last year s National People s Conference while other provinces reached the target of $50 000.Cde Ncube echoed Cde Bitu s sentiments that by resigning from the women s league, Cde Moyo had also forfeited her Parliamentary seat.On Cde Kasukuwere, Cde Ncube said he could not be allowed to continue destroying the party. And what do you say about this Commissar (Cde Kasukuwere) who is chasing people from the party. It is like he is running a company called Hire and Fire, to an extent that you can be fired for simply coughing. The late Cde Elliot Manyika used to say the party is not like a water glass, it doesn t fill up so we need people in the party and not chase them away. When some were thinking that they were in positions, they did not know that parallel structures were being set up in offices to replace them. Members of the wing were then given the floor to air their views and they were unanimous that Cde Moyo should be recalled from Parliament and Cde Kasukuwere sacked.
