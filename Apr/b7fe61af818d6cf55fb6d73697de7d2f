Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has received applications from two different Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to set up solar photovoltaic power plants in Bulawayo and Beitbridge. The planned project by Uhuru Energy in Bulawayo s Westgate suburb is expected to generate 75 megawatts to be fed into the national grid.Nottingham Estates in Beitbridge also seeks to construct and operate a 1,5MW solar photovoltaic power plant and a 0,75MW diesel back up power plant.Zera said the applications had been done in terms of the provisions of Sections 40 and 46 of the Electricity Act (Chapter 13:19) of 2002. The proposed 75MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Donnington West, Bulawayo . . . would include construction of a two-kilometre line from the proposed Uhuru Energy solar plant to the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company s (ZETDC) Donnington 132-88/11Kv substation, it said in a notice.In a separate notice, Zera said it had also received an application from Nottingham Estates to construct, own, operate and maintain the 1,5MW solar photovoltaic and 0,75MW diesel back up power plants at Nottingham Estates in Beitbridge. The project is located in Beitbridge district, 35 kilometres south-west of the Beitbridge-Bulawayo highway adjacent to the Limpopo River. The project would also include connection to the ZETDC 11Kv line which runs about five metres away from the intended point, said the regulatory authority.Since 2010, Zera has been inviting applications from potential investors to set up power plants as Independent Power Producers (IPPs).So far, about 25 IPPs have been licensed to set up the power plants. Due to a number of factors including funding, the projects are at different stages of implementation.However, some of the projects have taken off and are already feeding to the national grid.@okazunga
