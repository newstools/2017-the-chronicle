Coach Farai Mahari named 25 players for the tournament which starts on Thursday and ends on Sunday.Mahari said two players he would have wanted to take to Madagascar were ruled out by injury. Centre Anthony Tanner and fullback Kudzai Munhangi will miss the trip to Madagascar due to injury.Prop Tapiwa Tsikai, who had initially been dropped from camp, has been recalled due to concerns in the front row.Mahari is convinced they have a balanced squad consisting of sharp players with the only areas needing attention being confidence and his team s defensive pattern. We have a great balance; we have good highly intelligent players so we should be good in a space. We have to grow our confidence and defence, other than that we are well prepared, said Mahari.A squad of 33 players initially went into camp at Churchill High School in Harare last Monday and eight that did not make the final team were released.Four players have been entrusted with the team leadership, with each of them given specific roles. The captain in charge of the camp is second centre Shingirai Katsvere, flank Zvikomborero Muzorewa will lead the team on match days, the lineout leader is number eight Aiden Burnett, while first centre Takudzwa Gamanya is the tactical skipper.Zimbabwe take on Kenya on Thursday, the same day that Namibia play against Madagascar, with the winners meeting in Sunday s final.The winner of the tournament will qualify for the World Rugby Under-20 Trophy to be held in Uruguay from August 29 to September 10.Zimbabwe Under-20 teamEdwin Nxumalo, Aspiration Mutore, Tinotenda Msasanure, Tapiwa Tsikai, Moses Gunda, Zvikomborero Muzorewa, Tichaona Hwangwa, Aiden Burnett, Takudzwa Gamanya, Tamuka Pamire, Shingirai Katsvere, Akim Dick, Deanne Makoni, Tinashe Muchena, Scott Young, Pride Nyameni, Albert Garira, Ralph Tirivanhu, Tinotenda Savanhu, Jeremiah Jaravaza, Shingirai Hlanguyo, Gregory Mhindu, Gerald Waterfall, Adrian Zvarevashe, Russell DinhaHead coach: Farai MahariAssistant coach: Jeffrey MadhakeTeam manager: Sean ChigumburaPhysiotherapist: Abigail Mnikwa @Mdawini_29
