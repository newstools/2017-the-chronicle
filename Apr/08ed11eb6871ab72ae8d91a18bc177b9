When this happened the complainant`s mother and the accused`s granddaughter were preparing lunch outside the house at a fire place. The complainant`s mother found the accused person naked while the complainant was lying on top of the bed, said Mr Moyo. This made the complainant`s mother suspicious and she reported the matter to the police. The complainant was rushed to the hospital and a medical report will be produced in court as evidence. @cynthiamthembo1
