ZaharaAFRO-POP songstress Zahara has allegedly fallen out of favour with the youngsters she mentors. This after former Idols SA 2013 contestants, Anele and Neliswa Mxhakaza, for the show s 2013 season claim the musician has yet to pay them for their song.Insiders claimed Zahara had shown no interest in paying the twins, and was avoiding them.Said the first source: She hasn t spoken to or mentioned them since the track, Bomi Endibaziyo, was made. Zahara took advantage of the twins as they were young. She made them believe she would help them achieve their goals, but that wasn t the case. A second source claimed Zahara promised to mentor Anele and Neliswa after the track was recorded, because she knew how it was like for girls who came to the City of Gold to pursue their music careers .Said the source: She promised to protect them from the vultures of the music industry. And the twins really looked up to and trusted her as their big sister. Anele and Neliswa first sang the song on Idols.When called for comment, Zahara said: I honestly wouldn t know if they were paid or not. I tried to mentor them, I kept calling them, but they just disappeared and kept quiet. I love empowering other women and I tried that with the twins. This week the twins phones were off. Dailysun.
