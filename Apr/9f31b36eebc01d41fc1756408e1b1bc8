On the way to his home, he said he has an ejaculation problem and asked for anal sex. I charged him $50 but we didn t have the anal sex, said Moyo. After rendering my services, he started making excuses for payment. He said his money was at the bank and he could only get it in the morning. He went to sleep. I woke him up and he snapped at me saying if I kept pestering him he would end up not paying for services without a receipt. I took his cell phones and went away. I didn t take his money .Prosecuting, Mr Kudakwashe Jaravaza told the court that on March 20 this year, Moyo met Mbuva at Club 263.He said they left the club around 3:30AM and went to Mbuva s house in Ilanda.
