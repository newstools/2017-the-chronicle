Knowledge NdlovuRichard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) has disbursed $31 000 to Gwanda Municipality for emergency infrastructure rehabilitation after rains destroyed most of the mining town s roads. Most of the roads in Gwanda are now littered with potholes and this has forced the town fathers to appeal to the road authority for funds to upgrade the network.Gwanda Mayor Councillor Knowledge Ndlovu yesterday confirmed the development. Initially we had applied for $1.4 million to rehabilitate all the town s roads. However, because of challenges which the country is facing the money could not come but our engineer told us that out of $ 31 000 which had been promised, $20 000 has been paid and we are going to get the remainder soon, said Clr Ndlovu.He said most of the damaged roads are in the high density suburbs. Zinara paid for specific roads which need to be rehabilitated. We are very grateful as the authority has been very forthcoming, said Clr Ndlovu.A 60-day emergency road rehabilitation programme has been instituted to improve the town s roads which were extensively damaged by rains.A tropical storm which hit the country two months ago destroyed many roads and other infrastructure.The Government is giving emergency response to the most affected areas.Last year the road authority allocated $300 000 to the council for the rehabilitation of the town s roads.The money was released after the local authority was able to account for $253 000 that it was allocated in 2015.The council rehabilitated 7,7 kilometres of Gwanda s road network and installed two sets of traffic lights. @richardmuponde
