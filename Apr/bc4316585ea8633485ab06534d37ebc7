POYBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent RAPPER POY says he wants to put behind the beef with Cal_Vin to focus on mentoring up-and-coming artistes. POY and Cal_Vin went at each other two weeks ago with both rappers dropping diss tracks during which, according to a public vote, Cal_Vin came out tops.Speaking for the first time after the beef, POY said he had no regrets because it was all about promoting the culture of hip hop. I m not about the negative vibes, we have to progress. Cal_Vin is a cool dude and he ll always be. I love his work ethic, we come from the same era. We did something for Zim hip hop and that s what counts, said POY.The Bulawayo two-time Zim Hip Hop award-winning rapper said he was now focusing on promoting artistes under his tutelage. I m working on boosting and mentoring a lot of up-and-coming artists like Young Stan, Kidd Locco, Sinkay, Six Oh and many others, even school children.I want them to grow their music careers so that their talent is recognised in the industry. Cal_vinHe urged the new artistes to take part in the Bigger Than Hip Hop a platform for hip hop artistes to battle it out as a way of sharpening their acts. The gathering is held at the Terrace Gardens, mostly at the end of the month. It s now my responsibility to push these up-and-coming rappers as I also had mentors like Francis Maponga and Victor Olonga. I want them to sharpen their live performance skills through the Bigger Than Hip Hop platform as I also benefit a lot from it. POY, who is riding high on his new video, Higher, said he would be releasing more music videos. @bonganinkunzi
