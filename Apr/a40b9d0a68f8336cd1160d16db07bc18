Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Executive Interaction Initiative (EII) Bulawayo Chapter will hold a fun shoot at Imbizo Barracks Shooting Range tomorrow. EII Bulawayo Chapter chairman Jabulani Nkomo said the event would see members of the public mingling with members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA). We are calling on members of the public to come in their numbers. All is now ready from the army side and we are expecting a huge turnout from the public. This is the time for families to come and have a good time as we are going to have other activities like a jumping castle and a braai, said Nkomo. Shooting is a sport that is not popular in the country and if you look at the people who represent the country in regional or international events, most of them come from the uniformed forces. Through this event, we are trying to promote shooting to the public and maybe someone might get interested and adopt the sport .Each shoot will cost $5 and proceeds from the fun shoot will be donated to charity. Those unable to access cash can make transfers to HQ Bulawayo District Regimental Institute Imbizo Barracks, account number 1020183650183 FBC Jason Moyo.The Ell started 13 years ago at the behest of ZNA Commander Lieutenant-General Philip Valerio Sibanda as a way of creating synergies between the military and business community to create cordial and mutually beneficial interactive relationships between them.- @khumzallen.&nbsp;
