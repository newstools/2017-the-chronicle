Wilson MutekedeLovemore Zigara in Gweru SHABANIE Mine have reportedly approached Zifa requesting for the services of Wilson Mutekede for their Castle Lager Premiership match against Bulawayo City on Good Friday. The asbestos miners are without a coach following the appointment of Mutekede, who was their head coach, to the post of Zifa technical director last week.Mutekede was given the green light to oversee Shabanie Mine s encounter against Highlanders, which the Zvishavane side won 1-0 at Barbourfields Stadium.Sources within the Shabanie Mine camp said the executive had resolved to write to Zifa begging that Mutekede be allowed to take charge of their game against Bulawayo City.Shabanie Mine players were without a coach when they went through their paces at Maglas Stadium yesterday.Elias Marufu, the Chinda Boys chairman, said he would not entertain the media when contacted for comment.Zifa communications manager Xolisani Gwesela said they were yet to receive correspondence from the asbestos miners. We are yet to get official communication from them and we will only talk about it if we get it, said Gwesela.Mutekede assumed his new duties at Zifa on Monday and is overseeing a coaching clinic for grassroots coaches in Masvingo that ends on Friday.He said there had been overtures for him to take charge of the game against Bulawayo City, but the decision rested with Zifa. There are some people who still want me to be with Shabanie Mine and have approached me to bid the fans farewell at home on Friday, said Mutekede. However, that decision rests with Zifa because they are the people I have a contract with. I will abide by a Zifa decision, otherwise I do not have a problem with that. Former Shabanie Mine midfielder Lennon Chisunga said the developments in the asbestos miners camp are likely to affect the rhythm of the team. Shabanie is in top form at the moment and any changes at this stage are likely to affect the rhythm of the team. My plea is for the (Shabanie Mine) executive and Zifa to find a workable arrangement until maybe mid-season before the club hires a new coach, Chisunga said.Gwesela said Zifa would not grant any special dispensation to Shabanie.@lavuzigara1
