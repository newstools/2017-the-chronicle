Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter REPRESENTATIVES of a Zimbabwe Diaspora investment group based in the United Kingdom (UK) are in the country to engage the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) on possible business partnerships. The recently formed group has expressed interest in tapping economic opportunities in the country and contributing to national development.One of the group founder members and leader Mr Hillary Chindodo said his team was now doing groundwork ahead of official launch of their programme in Zimbabwe. I m in Zimbabwe to lay the groundwork for our launch. We are here to complete the appropriate registration requirements and meet with investment partners, he said.Mr Chindodo told Business Chronicle that his group plans to open an office in the country so as to ensure efficient engagements with local businesses. We will be opening a Harare office and registering with the Zimbabwe Investment Authority. We will also launch our investment-matching service at the same time as our official opening, he added.Mr Chindodo said his group was looking at the wider economy where there are opportunities that can assist the country in creating employment. For instance when we put money in health care to build a hospital, it will mean lot of employment in the different sectors of the economy. This improves the health care system in the country, which plays a big role in the functioning of the country, he said.Mr Chindodo said his organisation was inspired by many countries that were benefiting from Diaspora investments. People in the Diaspora are glad to invest back home and be part of the mainstream economy. Back then people invested in buying kombis but for us we are doing things differently as we want to speak to the economy, he said.Mr Chindodo said his organisation will seek partnerships with emerging market investors, financial and developmental institutions that have interest in partnering them.He said Diaspora involvement was crucial in addressing the much needed foreign currency and creating employment opportunities.@Kiyaz_Cool
