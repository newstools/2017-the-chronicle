Sharon Chiware, Midlands Reporter GWERU City Council has said it might be forced to re-tender for $1,2 million earth-moving equipment after a local company Rubitech which won the tender failed to deliver within the stipulated period. Rubitech won the tender in November last year for the supply of equipment that include a grader, bulldozer, backhaul loader, and excavator.The equipment was supposed to have been delivered last year, but only a grader has been delivered.Town clerk Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza said the delay in delivering the equipment has resulted in council failing to maintain its road network as well as service stands in Mkoba 21. We have not received all the equipment that we tendered for because the company that was awarded the tender to procure the equipment has not delivered. They keep telling us that they are yet to be allocated foreign currency for them to bring in the equipment, she said. The process has hampered our plans to repair our roads and servicing of Mkoba 21 stands and it s now incumbent upon council on whether we vary the conditions of the initial tender or we go for the company which came second in the tendering process. I think all things being equal we need to go to the second one depending on whether the second one is within our budget. @sharonchiware1
