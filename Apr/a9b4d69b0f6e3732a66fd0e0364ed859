Alick MachesoNhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent KING of sungura Alick Macheso and Clement Magwaza of the Makokotsha fame are set to square it off at Manor Hotel in Bulawayo on Friday. The last time they shared the stage was last year at Stanley Square where they attracted a bumper crowd. From there, they have staged a series of shows together and are even working on a collaboration.Both artistes who are famed for their stage wizardry are set to take their fans on a new musical journey as Macheso has a surprise track for his fans while Magwaza will sample few tracks from his forthcoming album.Organiser of the show, Assan Mandizvidza Mugumbate said music lovers were in for a rare treat as the duo is a crowd favourite. Macheso and Magwaza are legends of their own genres. It s undisputable that they command strong crowds and they re people s favourites. The show and probably many more to come will be a platform for the musicians to musically feed their fans, said Assan.Assan said highlights of the gig would be when the two perform new songs which they have been working on. Whenever Macheso or Magwaza are in studio, there s a notable wave of excitement and expectations among their fans. During the show, both artistes have promised to play new, exciting songs for their fans, and I m confident they won t disappoint. Quizzed about the capacity of Manor Hotel Hall, Assan said the venue came as a last resort, but quickly defended it saying it had the potential to house a lot of people. We tried several venues, but they were already booked. Our last resort was ZITF and they told us they no longer offer venues for night shows. As a result, Manor Hotel was the only viable option. Tickets to the show have been pegged at $5, while the first 50 people will get in for free and receive T-shirts and caps.&nbsp;
