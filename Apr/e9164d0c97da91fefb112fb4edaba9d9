IGAZI, the popular isiXhosa melodrama, is back on TV screens for the start of season two. Last year, the finale of the drama that tells the story of a Xhosa royal family in conflict over the nation s throne, left many disappointed when Nomarussia (Vatiswa Ndara) was charged for the murder of Jonga (Thami Mngqolo).This season, the truth unfolds about the reasons behind Nomarussia s incarceration as she comes to terms with Jonga s murder. In this new season, expect more drama and chaos from Nomarussia, Ndara warns.The new season s stellar cast includes former Generations actors Zikhona Sodlaka, Zenande Mfenyana, Anga Makubalo and Zolisa Xaluva. Igazi is available on Mzansi Magic (DStv channel 161) on Sunday at 8PM.Ndara said when producers at Ferguson Films briefed her about her character, she had a completely different picture in mind. She thought Nomarussia was a simple Eastern Cape woman. But when she went for her wardrobe fittings and read the script she realised that she was going to be an evil and mad woman.So, what do Ndara and Nomarussia have in common? Have you noticed how Nomarussia s lines are so stupid at times? Nomarussia and I have a sense of humour; I like laughing and talking nonsense at times, and I think Nomarussia is exactly like me. Asked if she has ever received a smack from an angry fan, Ndara said: You d be surprised. They always comment on social media, but when I meet them in person, they re always surprised and say to me: This can t be you! You re so sweet! You look young and different . Her favourite tweet from a fan so far is: You can give Vatiswa any role, she can even play a goat. CityPress.
