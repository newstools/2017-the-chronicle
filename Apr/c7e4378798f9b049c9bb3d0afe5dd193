Lovemore Zigara in Gweru GOLD MINERS Blanket Mine edged Whawha 1 0 in their opening match of the Zifa Central Soccer League on Saturday. Luckious Nakwi s header 10 minutes after the breather was all Blanket Mine needed to secure maximum points.Whawha were left to rue their missed chances after dominating the entire game. They even hit the woodwork three times as their strikers took turns to miss the target.The prison warders are among the favourites to clinch the CSL s sole promotional ticket to the topflight league having bolstered their side during the off-season with players from the now defunct Zifa Southern Region outfit Ntabazinduna and Flame Lily.Despite the defeat, Whawha coach Luke Petros-Jukulile said he was happy with performances of the new arrivals, as they were fitting well to his style of play. It was disappointing to lose all the points, especially playing at home, but the good thing is that players from our sister clubs, which were collapsed, are fitting well into our style of play. I am confident that we will pick ourselves up and come out with a positive result in the next game, said Petros-Jukulile.His Blanket Mine counterpart Barnet Vhinkumbu was ecstatic following the victory. I am happy that we managed to collect all three points despite the fact that we were on the back foot for the better part of the match. We lost many players during the off-season, but I am happy that we found capable replacements. Our mission is to push harder than what we did last season and see how things go, said Vhinkumbu.In other matches, Nichrut were held to a goalless draw by Chrome Stars, while FC Platinum Under-19 overcame newly promoted Telone 1 0 at Mandava Stadium on Sunday.The matches pitting Border Strikers with ZRP Gwanda and Silo United and Gwanda United were not played because the police clubs were involved in the ZRP Commissioner General s gala.ResultsNichrut 0-0 Chrome Stars, FC Platinum U19 1-0 TelOne, Kwekwe Stars 1-1 MSU, Vumbachikwe 1-2 ZPC Munyati, Black Eagles 1-1 Makusha, Whawha 0-1 Blanket Mine, Tongogara 2-1 Ivan Hoe, Border Strikers vs ZRP Gwanda (match not played), Silo United vs Gwanda United (match not played).TableP W D L F A GD Pts Tongogara 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 3 ZPC Munyati 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 3 FC Platinum U19 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 3 Blanket Mine 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 3 Black Eagles 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 Kwekwe Stars 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 MSU 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 Makusha 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 Nichrut 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 Chrome Stars 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 Border Strikers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Silo United 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ZRP Gwanda 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gwanda United 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vumbachikwe 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0 Ivan Hoe 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0 Whawha 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0 TelOne 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0@lavuzigara1
