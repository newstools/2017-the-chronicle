DJ NospaBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent WHAT started off as a beautiful day to celebrate a birthday ended in tragedy for wheel spinner DJ Nospa as his car was vandalised by unknown people outside Club Eden in Bulawayo in the early hours of Sunday. While the popular DJ was celebrating his 29th birthday by churning out tunes for an appreciative crowd, some people allegedly used the opportunity to either sabotage or attempt to steal from him.A bottle was used to hit the back windscreen of his Mazda Familia and fortunately, there were people who had just slept in the vehicle. According to Nospa, upon hearing a loud sound, the people in the car woke up forcing the perpetrator/s to flee. After concluding my set just after 4AM, I left two of my friends in the car briefly as I returned to the club to collect my little sister. A few minutes later, one of my friends came running to me saying someone had hit my car with a bottle of Savannah and disappeared into the night, said the DJ.On Sunday, he posted a picture of his damaged windscreen on his Facebook page. He described the incident as a clear act of sabotage. The person didn t want to steal anything, they wanted to vandalise my car. I don t know why but I ve since reported the matter to the police, said Nospa.He also wrote a note to the perpetrator/s. Dear hater, thank you for the birthday present, I m sure it made you feel better. You decided to spit on it before breaking it. Definition of witchcraft. The artiste is now working on repairing the windscreen.Before playing at Club Eden, Nospa had also rocked the decks at Miss Nust.
