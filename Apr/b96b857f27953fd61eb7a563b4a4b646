He received his early education at Otavi in Namibia under the hated Bantu Education System.He joined the Augustineum Training College in 1958 where most of today s prominent political leaders of Namibia were educated.In 1960, he was expelled from Augustineum for having participated in a march to protest the poor quality of education. He was, however, re-admitted and was able to finish the teacher-training course in 1961. Subsequently, he took up a teaching position at the Tsumeb Primary School in Central Namibia but soon discovered that his thirst for knowledge was unlikely to be quenched in Namibia. As a teacher, he also hated being an unwilling instrument in perpetuating the Bantu Education System.Therefore, at the end of the school year, he left his job to seek knowledge and instruction that could help him change the system.
