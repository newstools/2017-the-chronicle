Andy MuridzoShowbiz Reporter ANDY Muridzo, the man allegedly responsible for Beverly Sibanda s pregnancy, appears to be in a celebratory mode after the controversial dancer sensationally claimed she had suffered a miscarriage last week. The Dherira hit-maker, who had always denied being responsible for Bev s pregnancy saying the dancer was out to tarnish his image, took to social media to post a video with his wife Chido Manyange as if to spite Bev.In the video where he is captured with a beaming smile passionately kissing his wife who is popularly known as Mai Keketso, Andy calls Bev a hater who is bent on soiling his flourishing marriage.Muridzo also thanked fans for popularising his yekedero chant. I d like to thank people for making the chant Yekedero a national anthem. Even those who hate us (in apparent reference to Bev) have made it popular. All we can say is that we love each other and we don t care about what people say, before signing off the video with a kiss.Thereafter, fans gave their two cents on the matter with most saying the Military Touch Movement artiste had learnt his lesson and needed to stop growing a big head and focus on his career and family.Jackie Napanashe Rhatisai said: Akazodzidza. Zvemabhebhi hazvibhadare (He s learnt his lesson that having girlfriends doesn t benefit him at all). However, fans took time to scrutinise the video and realised that there was a slight resemblance between Mai Keketso and Bev. Some said before watching the video, they thought it was Bev on the teaser.Bee Tee Shawneewah wrote: Thought it was Bev. Wow!! Andy has the same taste, Mai Keketso and Bev look alike. &nbsp;
