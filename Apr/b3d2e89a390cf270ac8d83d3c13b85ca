Thulani SibandaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Chiefs coach Thulani Sibanda has ruled out complacency from his side ahead of their Southern Region Division One Soccer League encounter against Victoria Falls Tigers at the resort town this afternoon. Chiefs are at the top of the table with six points from two games 2-0 win against Bosso 90 and 1-0 victory over ZPC Hwange and coach Sibanda believes Tigers who anchor the table pose are capable of pulling a shocker in the event that they underrate their opponents. We re going to Victoria Falls in search of maximum points. We just want to maintain our 100 percent record and to do so we have to approach each game as if it s a final. The good thing is that the players understand the importance of maintaining a winning streak and we re going all out for maximum points.We are aware that Tigers will not be pushovers, especially playing at home and that is why I ve told the guys that we need to concentrate throughout the game. I want them to replicate the performance that they put when we fought for that 1-0 win against ZPC Hwange last week, said Sibanda.The midfield trio of Gracious Muleya, Moses Majika, Mthulisi Maphosa, goalkeeper Kelvin Nyoni and strikers Farawo Matare and Kundishora Chakanyuka are expected to lead Chiefs search for victory.An advantage that Chiefs have is that they have played two games and are on groove while Tigers will be playing their first match of the season having been on a bye on Week One before being walked over by ZRP Bulawayo last weekend.Tigers will be aiming at making amends for the two weekends they were inactive.Casmyn are heavily breathing on Chiefs neck, sitting on position two with four points.Casmyn are at White City Stadium this afternoon to take on Chiwororo who are bubbling with confidence following their 2-1 win against Talen Vision.The victory against Vision who finished last season strongly is likely to be a confidence booster for Chiwororo.However, Casmyn who have former Highlanders and Lancashire Steel winger Wellington Gripa Sibanda in their side could turn out to be among title dark horses.Perennial First Division campaigners ZPC Hwange are at home to newboys Zim Leopards with Vision also travelling to Hwange for a date with Makomo.Police force sides ZRP Bulawayo and Black Boots clash at Fairbridge with Indlovu Iyanyathela-Mosi Rovers encounter completing matches lined up for the weekend.Week Three FixturesToday: ZPC Hwange v Zim Leopards (Hwange), Victoria Falls Tigers v Bulawayo Chiefs (Victoria Falls), Black Boots v ZRP Bulawayo Province (Fairbridge), Amagagasi v Moto Moto (cancelled), Chiwororo v Casmyn (White City, 12PM), Makomo v Talen Vision (Hwange), Indlovu Iyanyathela v Mosi Rovers (Brad Barracks), Bosso 90 (BYE)P W D L F A GD PTSBulawayo Chiefs 2 2 0 0 3 0 3 6Casmyn 2 1 1 0 2 0 2 4ZPC Hwange 2 1 0 1 3 1 2 3Mosi Rovers 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 3Indlovu Iyanyathela 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 3Chiwororo 2 1 0 1 3 3 0 3ZRP Bulawayo 2 1 0 1 3 3 0 3Amagagasi 2 1 1 0 0 2 -2 1Black Boots 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1Zim Leopards 2 0 1 1 3 4 -1 1Talen Vision 2 0 1 1 1 2 -1 1Bosso 90 2 0 1 1 3 5 -2 1Makomo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Moto Moto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Vic Falls Tigers 1 0 0 1 0 3 -3 0 @ZililoR
