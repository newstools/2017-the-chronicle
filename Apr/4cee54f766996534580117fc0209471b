Tonderai NdirayaTobias Mandoreba in Hwange Hwange 0-3 Ngezi Platinum HWANGE S first home game of the 2017 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season turned into a nightmare after being clobbered by visiting Ngezi Platinum Stars at the Colliery Stadium yesterday.The exodus of players from Hwange during the off-season was telling as the Mhondoro-based platinum miners ran off comfortable winners through second half goals from Washington Pakamisa, Donald Teguru and substitute Tatenda Mchisa in injury time.Ngezi started the match on a high tempo and could have raced into the lead as early as the 5th minute when overlapping defender Nielson Ketala unleashed a rasping shot from the edge of the box, but it was well dealt with by Hwange goal minder Taimon Mvula.Three minutes later, Tichaona Mabvura just missed the target by a few inches with Mvula diving in vain.The visitors continued to camp in the Hwange half and launched raid after raid, but they somehow could not draw first blood.They finally found the breakthrough in the 51st minute when Pakamisa grabbed the opener for Ngezi through a grounder that took an awkward bounce and deceived the diving Mvula.Ngezi goalkeeper Nelson Chadya denied Hwange an immediate response in the 55th minute when he acrobatically tipped a glancing header by Shepherd Gadzikwa over the bar for a corner kick.With Hwange huffing and puffing for an equaliser, Ngezi doubled their advantage in the 80th minute after defender Houdlacks Kaunda slipped in an attempt to clear a loose ball, leaving Teguru with all the time in the world to coolly slot home past Mvula.Hwange s condemnation was sealed in the first minute of added time when substitute Mchisa tapped in a simple goal following some brilliant work by Ketala on the left flank.Hwange coach Nation Dube admitted that his youngsters couldn t contain the well drilled Ngezi side. The young boys tried their best as we are in a learning stage with a number of new faces. Holding a team like Ngezi, who were playing in Africa (Caf Confederation Cup) for the entire opening half, shows there is potential. We let in some soft goals, but I believe we can dust ourselves and fight going forward, said Dube.His Ngezi counterpart Tonderai Ndiraya heaped praise on his charges. My players did well because coming to a difficult place like the Colliery to win comfortably is pleasing and refreshing. We will take each game as it comes, but we want to make a huge impression this season, he said.TeamsHwange: T Mvula; A Tshuma; G Ndlovu; H Kaunda; N Chinyerere; C Muleya; W Munorwei (A Banda 53th min); S Chichevo; O Lungu; S Gadzikwa; G ZuluNgezi Platinum: N Chadya; N Ketala; G Murwira; P Jaure; D Teguru (E Mhungu 81st min); T Dzukamanja (T Mchisa 89th min); T Mabvura; L Chakoroma; D Mukandi; K Murera; W Pakamisa (C Augusto 65th min).@tobymandox
