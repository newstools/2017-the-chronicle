THE Zimbabwe senior national cricket side will visit the Netherlands for three one-day internationals in June before proceeding to Sri Lanka for a Test and limited-overs series. The matches against the Netherlands scheduled for June 20, 22 and 24, 2017, will come just days after Zimbabwe s two ODIs against Scotland in Edinburgh.The Scotland fixtures are penciled in for June 15 and 17, with Zimbabwe expected to leave for the Netherlands on the following day.Zimbabwe Cricket managing director Wilfred Mukondiwa welcomed the tours against Associate sides, saying this would provide Zimbabwe with the much-needed game time. We are pleased to confirm Zimbabwe will be touring the Netherlands as part of a potentially exciting and competitive five-game programme that will also see us visiting Scotland for two of the matches, said Mukondiwa. While the tour will give our boys the much-needed game time and a feel of unfamiliar conditions, it will also go a long way in preparing our team for the tougher series away to Sri Lanka.
