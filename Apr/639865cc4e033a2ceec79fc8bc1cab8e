Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter LOCAL pharmaceutical and personal care products manufacturer Datlabs Limited says it is targeting five percent growth this year to be achieved through aggressive marketing. Speaking during the company s winter campaign training programme in Bulawayo last week, product manager, Mr Lobhengula Dube, said increasing sales was the avenue towards the targeted growth. Our work plan for 2017 is targeting a growth of five percent from what we have been doing now. We are also trying to drive our products with intensive marketing as this would help us to sell our products to our clients. We want to make sure that our products are available to the market. The marketing campaign of Camphacare on the social media platforms has worked wonders and we hope all our products would be appreciated that way, said Mr Dube.He told Business Chronicle on the sidelines of the meeting that the company expected improved sales towards the coming winter season.Mr Dube said their branded products were doing well in the market despite the challenging macro-economic environment. Our brands have resisted the tide and I can say we are claiming our market share, he said. @Kiyaz_Cool
