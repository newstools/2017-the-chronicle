Trackers then found his backpack nearby.Matabeleland South police spokesperson yesterday confirmed receiving a report of a missing person. I can confirm that we received a report of a missing South African hunter on the Zimbabwean side in Chikwalakwala area. A search has been made but he not been found but his belongings were found on the banks of the Limpopo River. However, I can t confirm that he was killed by crocodiles as we have not received such information as yet, he said.The British Telegraph newspaper quoted Mr Sakkie Louwrens, who was involved in the search, saying police and nature conservation services had decided to shoot two Nile crocodiles in the area after suspecting that they may have been responsible for Mr van Zyl s disappearance. We found what could possibly be human remains in them, he said.The paper said forensic experts are currently testing whether the remains belong to Mr van Zyl, who has a wife and two children.At least four people have been killed by crocodiles in the past month after heavy rains caused the reptiles to move away from rivers.One of the latest victims is an 11-year-old boy, Mphathi Ndlovu, who was killed by a crocodile while he was swimming in the Kana River with two friends.Villagers from Jotsholo village in Matabeleland North tracked down the crocodile and killed it with machetes before skinning it and recovering some of the boy s body parts. @richardmuponde
