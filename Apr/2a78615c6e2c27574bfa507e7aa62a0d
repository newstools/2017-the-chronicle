Taurai MangwiroGrace Chingoma, Harare Bureau TRIANGLE coach Taurai Mangwiro will be looking for a full set of points when he meets basement team Bantu Rovers in a Castle Lager Premiership soccer tie at Luveve this afternoon. The clash features two teams who are yet to win a match in the opening two matches of the new season.And for the Bulawayo-based side Bantu Rovers what has only been striking is that they have conceded eight goals after 180 minutes of football.But Mangwiro is not reading much into that as he also chases his first victory following two draws against Dynamos and Chapungu. There is always a first time for everything and I hope tomorrow (today) we will get it right. We played two difficult games (against Dynamos and Chapungu) and we had to settle for draws even though we would have loved to get all the six points&#8230;It s not easy, said Mangwiro.The former Caps United and Harare City coach though is wary of Bantu Rovers threat. Our opponents have lost twice so they would want to redeem themselves in this game. You can see there was marked a improvement from them. After conceding five goals against Chicken Inn in the opening game they went on to score two goals while conceding three against FC Platinum. But we are not reading much into that, we are concentrating on our own game, Mangwiro said.The new Triangle mentor, who replaced David Yogi Mandigora at the beginning of the season, said he is adjusting to the life in the Lowveld and he is happy that his players are fusing well.The former ZIFA technical director is also cherishing meeting one of his mentors Methembe Ndlovu.Mangwiro was assistant to the Bantu Rovers director when he was still in charge of the national Under-20 team.Meanwhile, high-riding Ngezi Platinum maintained their lead on the summit of the log after another fine performance at Baobab where they beat How Mine 2-0 at the weekend.The Mhondoro-based side have picked up six points from their opening two matches of the n ew season.The only other team which hasn t dropped points is FC Platinum. Their league match against Chicken Inn was postponed to pave way for Independence Cup semi-final tie against Highlanders at Barbourfields yesterday.Ngezi Platinum s goals against How Mine came from exciting forward Terence Dzukamanja who scored a brace.So far Tonderayi Ndiraya s team have not been relying from the same player to provide the goals for them.In the previous match against Hwange, they got their goals from forward Washington Pakamisa, midfielder Donald Teguru and defender Tatenda Mchisa while striker Clive Augusto snatched the winner when he scored in the 90th minute to deny Premiership returnees a point at Baobab.Also continuing with their unbeaten run were Yadah who settled for a goalless draw against Tsholotsho in Beitbridge.The newboys have two draws and a victory against ZPC Kariba in their maiden top flight season.Results at a glanceGood Friday: Ngezi 2, How Mine 0; Chapungu 1, Hwange 2; Tsholotsho 0, Yadah 0.FixturesToday: Bantu Rovers v Triangle (Luveve).Postponed: Chicken Inn v FC Platinum, Dynamos v Black Rhinos, Harare City v Highlanders, ZPC Kariba v CAPS United.P W D L GF GA GD PtsNgezi Platinum 3 3 0 0 5 0 5 9FC Platinum 2 2 0 0 4 2 2 6Bulawayo City 3 2 0 1 4 3 1 6Yadah FC 3 1 2 0 1 0 1 5CAPS United 2 1 1 0 2 1 1 4Hwange FC 3 1 1 1 2 3 -1 4Shabanie Mine 3 1 1 1 1 2 -1 4Chicken Inn 2 1 0 1 6 2 4 3Highlanders FC 2 1 0 1 2 1 1 3Black Rhinos FC 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 3Tsholotsho FC 3 0 3 0 1 1 0 3ZPC Kariba 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 3Triangle United 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2Dynamos FC 2 0 1 1 2 3 -1 1Harare City 2 0 1 1 1 2 -1 1Chapungu FC 3 0 1 2 1 3 -2 1How Mine FC 3 0 1 2 1 4 -3 1Bantu Rovers 2 0 0 2 2 8 -6 0&nbsp;
