Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP side Chapungu United have roped in Rodwell Dhlakama as technical manager. Dhlakama was head coach of another Air Force of Zimbabwe outfit Blue Swallows in the Zifa Northern Region Division One League.Chapungu chairman Hillary Jona said Dhlakama was brought in to comply with club licensing requirements which require two members of the technical department to be Caf A Licence holders. We have roped in Rodwell Dhlakama as our technical manager. He is coming to assist the technical department and the move is part of our compliance with the new Zifa licensing requirements, said Jona.Head coach Tendai Chikuni is the only member of the Chapungu technical team with a Caf A licence, while his assistant Clement Mugari holds a Caf B licence.The club is yet to name a goalkeepers coach following the death of Brighton Muchambo.Chapungu have had an indifferent start to the season and have a single point from the 0-0 stalemate against Triangle on the opening day of the season.The airmen anchor the league table following their 1-2 loss to How Mine on Saturday.Their poor run comes despite decent pre-season preparations.Chapungu bolstered their squad during the off-season by acquiring Zifa Central Soccer League Soccer Star of the Year Ricky Bota, Livingstone Genti, Lloyd Gwerina, Blessing Sahondo, Kelvin Bingala, Raymond Sibanda and Nigel Papius.@lavuzigara1
