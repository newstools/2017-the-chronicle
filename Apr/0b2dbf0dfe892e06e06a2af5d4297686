Collapsing of graves is primarily caused by soil subsiding after heavy rains and this year heavy rains were experienced leading to more graves collapsing.Council has the responsibility of backfilling the collapsed graves. Council is currently making preparations to fill the graves following the subsiding of heavy rains, said Mrs Mpofu.Bulawayo United Residents Association chairman Mr Winos Dube said residents were concerned about lack of proper maintenance at cemeteries. It s an area of concern that must be given much attention. We have raised that with the council on several platforms. If graves are collapsing it raises even health concerns. We strongly appeal to the council to move fast in addressing this, he said.Mr Dube said even the relatives of deceased persons should take it upon themselves to ensure that graves of their loved ones are in a respectable condition. The residents should also come forward to refill the graves of their relatives, said Mr Dube. @nqotshili
