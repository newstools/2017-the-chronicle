Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange A Hwange-based businessman Reeds Dube has sourced 40 soccer balls worth $1 200 to be donated to rural schools and community teams. The first donation was made to Nekatambe Secondary School and Dinde Primary School last week before the inaugural Reeds Dube Soccer tournament was held on Easter Monday.Silver Stars FC won the tournament after edging Supercows FC 4-3 on penalties in the final and walked away with $40 and a soccer ball, while runners up Supercows received a ball and $30.Talented Stars youngster Zenzo Zulu was voted player of the tournament.Other teams that also participated in the tournament are Power Dinde, Zebras FC, Chamashoko and Lulu Rovers. I have been a passionate soccer person from my youth but I have come to realise that more focus is in the urban areas when we talk of sport development, hence this gesture towards the rural folks. After this, I will also bankroll the training of coaches and referees from within the district so that football standards improve and we can also have a few talented footballers emerging, said Dube.Sports and Recreation Commission Matabeleland North football instructor and Zimbabwe Under-17 national coach Weekly Mwale paid tribute to Dube for his contribution towards grassroots football development. This is a refreshing development as rural areas have been neglected. Even our national teams will end up faring better in future if the net is cast wider as there is an abundance of undiscovered football talent in rural areas. Zifa have of late been advocating for vibrant junior development programmes in the whole country and I am taking care of technical aspects in the training of coaches and referees within the district, said Mwale.@tobymandox
