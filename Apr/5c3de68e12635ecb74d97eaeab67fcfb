We received a report on the drowning of a 50-year-old man who reportedly went missing and was found floating in a river in a neighbouring village. His relative discovered early in the morning that he was not in his bedroom. He notified other villagers and together they started searching for him. They did not find him until after four days. They found his body floating in a river near Maplanka village, said Asst Insp Sibanda.He warned members of the public to be cautious when crossing rivers and not to attempt to cross flooded rivers. Due to the large amounts of rainfall that were received this year, we are warning members of the public not to underestimate water levels in water bodies as this has resulted in drowning incidents. Parents should always monitor their children and warn them not to play or do activities near water bodies, said Asst Insp Sibanda. @winnie_masara
