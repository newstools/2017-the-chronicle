Tendai ChikuniLovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU mentor Tendai Chikuni has hinted that he is likely to rotate his squad, as he feels he has enough depth in his squad. Despite his charges playing to a goalless draw against Triangle at the weekend, the new look Chapungu side earned respect from its supporters and neutrals alike with their passing game.Chikuni did not include last season s regulars in his squad for the Triangle game like defender Blessed Mbavarira, Allan Tavarwisa, skipper Phillip Marufu, Patrick Khumbula and Gift Phiri, among a host of players. Each and every game has got its own approach just like our next game against Black Rhinos. We will be playing away so we will change the players and also the system of play. So we are not going to stick to the same team which played today since we have got depth this season, said Chikuni. Some players that played today you won t see them next week because as much as I want results, I need to put competition in the team. (Black) Rhinos are more physical and we need players that are also robust so we will approach that game differently. The former Shabanie Mine coach said any talk of relegation this season was out of question. I can assure you that this season there is no way we can talk of relegation. We are going up there just as we have our own targets and not from the executive. I am a coach who wants to win things and I am trying to instil a winning mentality in the team and they are responding positively, he said.Expectations are high for Chapungu to perform better this season. The airmen finished fourth from the bottom last season and only remained in the topflight league following Zifa s directive that only two teams be relegated from the Premiership instead of four.The players welfare also received a major boost after BancABC committed to sponsoring the club this season and will take care of the club major expenses, such as winning bonuses and travelling expenses.@lavuzigara1
