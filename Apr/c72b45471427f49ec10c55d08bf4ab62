Methembe NdlovuAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter BANTU Rovers have named their president Methembe Ndlovu as substantive head coach after failing to find a candidate that suits the club s objectives. The club is now in the hunt for an assistant coach.Speaking to journalists at the club s weekly press briefing yesterday, Bantu Rovers general manager Wilbert Sibanda said Ndlovu s appointment ensures the club will not divert from its values of grooming young players and preparing them for professional careers or scholarships. We have decided to go with Methembe as our substantive head coach so we are now looking for an assistant coach. We want someone who will share the same vision and understands the club, said Sibanda.Tshintsha Guluva, as Bantu Rovers are known, had been without a head coach since the beginning of the season following a Zifa decree that all Premiership head honchos possess at least a Caf A Licence in line with the new club licensing system.The club had eyed Warriors legend Agent Sawu for the head coach s role, but Zifa deemed his English Football Association International Coaching badge inferior to the Caf A Licence.Sawu has subsequently been re-assigned as the first team manager and will also be in charge of the Bantu Rovers Under-18 team.Ndlovu acknowledged that it will not be an easy task balancing his duties as coach and club president. It s a big responsibility, one which I don t take lightly. Like we have said before, we really wanted someone who would wake up in the morning day after day coming to the ground, but things being the way they are, I have to take the job seriously with complete respect and commitment. I think the positive side is that I understand what the club is trying to accomplish. It s a difficult proposition to ask a coach who is trying to build or maintain their CV to take on this kind of responsibility. I will do my best to develop players and get results at the same time, Ndlovu said. @khumzallen
