Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A 10-YEAR-OLD boy died on the spot when an ox-drawn cart he was travelling in hit a tree stump and overturned, crushing his head. Keith Ncube of Mbembeswana 2, Ward 18, Village 1, under Chief Mtshana died while he was on his way to fetch water at a nearby borehole.The incident occurred at around 6PM on Sunday.A neighbour, Mr Abel Nyoni, who witnessed the incident, said four boys were in the scotch cart at the time of the accident. Their cattle suddenly got irritated and ran off the road resulting in the scotch cart hitting a tree stump before it overturned once. As it overturned, it threw the boys out to the ground and as it landed upside down, it hit Keith on the head. He sustained serious head injuries. We rushed to the scene and tried to apply first aid but it was all in vain as he bled profusely and died within a few minutes, he said.Ward 18 councillor, Mr Andrew Matshazi, said the scotch cart incident that killed the boy was the second one in the area within a week, although the first one was not fatal. We are disheartened by the way this young boy has died and we express our heartfelt condolences to the Ncube family. There is another villager battling for life at the United Bulawayo Hospitals who was injured by a scotch cart in this same area. Scotch carts accidents have become rampant and we urge villagers to be cautious when driving them. We are planning an awareness campaign which should be done as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary loss of lives, he said.Matabeleland North Police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Eglon Nkala could not be reached for comment as his phone went unanswered.@winnie_masara
