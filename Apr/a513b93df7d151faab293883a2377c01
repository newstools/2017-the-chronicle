(Picture by Nkosizile Ndlovu) Starting this year, Zimbabwe will be sending a team to the Under-15 Five-A-Side World Cup with participants selected from the COPA Coca-Cola schools tournament. Changing to the U-15s is meant to align our developmental programmes with Fifa recognised age-groups. We ve seen the likes of Kuda Mahachi (now at Golden Arrows, South Africa), Tatenda Mkuruva (Cape Town City, South Africa) and Netherlands-based Marvellous Nakamba participating at the tournament either at the finals or in the wards, said Chibanda. We will continue to select the Dream Team from which we will get players for the Five-A-Side World Cup. Our belief is that this initiative to recommend a team for the World Cup, which Coca Cola sponsors also, supports initiatives of the national FA to spruce and market Five-A-Side football. We re basically reiterating to our trend of being a leading partner in terms of being a leading grassroots and development of the sport. She said her company is also targeting using social media as a tool to market the tournament and to reach out to the youngsters. @ZililoR.
