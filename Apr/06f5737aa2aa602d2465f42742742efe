Russell DzeteCynthia Dube, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO magistrate has dismissed an application for refusal of further remand made by lawyer Russel Dzete who is facing a charge of fraud involving $22 600. Dzete (33) of Marondedze, Mukuku and Partners allegedly connived with Collet Dube (48) of Sizinda suburb and prejudiced Mr Ronald Ngorima of $22 600 in a fraudulent stand deal.Appearing before Magistrate Ms Sithembiso Ncube, Dzete said no proof has been submitted in court for the alleged fraud.The Magistrate, Ms Sithembiso Ncube, dismissed the refusal of further remand application saying she was satisfied that there was reasonable suspicion that Dzete was involved in a fraudulent transaction. The transaction was not a once off event but a process coupled with careful planning with an intent to deceive and profit, said Ms Ncube as she remanded Dzete and Dube to May 2.Dzete is out on bail while Dube is in custody.Allegations against the two are that they allegedly sold Mr Ngorima a stand belonging to one Mr Nelson Ngwenya of Matsheumhlope suburb in Bulawayo, without his authority.Prosecuting, Mr Alfonse Makonese said in February last year, the pair identified a vacant property belonging to Mr Ngwenya and engaged an estate agent to find a potential buyer. An advert was placed and attracted Ngorima. Ngorima contacted Dube. On a later date Dube took Ngorima to Dzete s workplace. The two accused persons, acting in common purpose produced a national identity card in the name of Ngwenya that had Dube s face inserted on it.Through the misrepresentation, Ngorima was prejudiced of $22 600, said Mr Makonese.The prosecutor said the offence came to light after Dzete was arrested for similar offences.Dzete has other cases before the courts.He is facing six counts of fraud involving $136 700 for the sale of residential stands.@cynthiamthembo1
