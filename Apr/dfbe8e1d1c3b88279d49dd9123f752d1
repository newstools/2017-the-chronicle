Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Government is mobilising resources to improve the teaching of science and related subjects in Matabeleland South province. The province has an acute shortage of the requisite infrastructure and human resources.Provincial Education Director Mrs Thumisang Tabela said in a recent interview that the limited facilities in the area, especially in most remote districts, had seen many children being deprived of participating in key Government programmes, including STEM. We have quite a number of barriers to learning for our children which we are looking at as a matter of urgency, she said. A shortage of resources and infrastructure is one of our main challenges as a province hence we have taken a position where we are urging schools to develop their own resource base. Part of our plan is having a situation where every secondary school offers at least two natural science subjects starting at Form Three.We have noted with concern that some schools have been offering a partial curriculum and we have started working on that area. Mrs Tabela said the aim was to train children in several skills.
