As Staff College we have a time when we do low intensity operations. Previously we were doing it theoretically but now we identify major battles that were fought during the war of liberation in various parts of the country and visit them, said Dept Commandant Mandeya.She said the process involves identifying witnesses of major battles and those who were involved in the battlefront as well as traditional leaders to give an account of events.
