We hope to meet international raw material suppliers and also equipment suppliers that we will work with in terms of retooling as we focus on promoting the country s industrial agenda, he said.In June 2016, the Government through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce promulgated SI64, which removes several goods from the Open General Import Licence as part of measures to control imports entering the country.Industry and Commerce Minister Dr Mike Bimha clarified that listed products would only be imported when local companies are not able to meet demand at specific intervals.As such Mr Jabangwe said this year s trade fair creates an opportunity for local companies to meet and negotiate with international buyers in different economic sectors. We also look forward to meeting both inward and outbound business partners that we can work with to re-industrialise the country, he added.Economist, Dr Gift Mugano, said the ZITF was a platform for local companies to continuously engage with foreign investors to unlock fresh capital as well as investment opportunities through models such as joint ventures. This is a trade fair where in the past we have seen traditional exhibitors from countries such as China participating and such a trend provides an opportunity for continuous business engagement with foreign investors. Also first time exhibitors will be able to negotiate for business deals, he said.Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce chief executive officer Mr Christopher Mugaga said businesses looked forward to the trade fair to open floodgates of potential investment opportunities.He said his organisation was upbeat about the exhibition space taken by exhibitors which was at 90 percent.Highlights of the five-day event include the ZITF International Business Conference tomorrow.
