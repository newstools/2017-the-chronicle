I wish I could get married soon because I believe I m old enough and mature for marriage. I m just waiting for the right person. I ve no kids either and I really feel it s about time I start a family. I ve got a niece who looks like me and some think she s my daughter, but she s my sister s child, said DJ Nospa.Describing himself as a mix DJ, Nospa said ever since he started his career in 2006, he has never regretted that decision. I became a DJ for the love of music. My parents loved music so basically it s a family thing. I also became a DJ because it s fun and at the same time, I ll be earning money. Also celebrating his birthday this weekend is another popular DJ, Kead Wikead. The resident DJ at Club Connect turned 29 on Thursday.With a career which spans 14 years, Kead said he felt he needed to assist up-and-coming DJs as he gets older and wiser. It s been 14 years in the game and I believe it s high time I groomed younger DJs. I was groomed by DJ Gunz and Mark Vusani and I feel there should be a next generation of DJs after ours that can take over and grow the industry, said Kead Wikead.The celebrations kicked off yesterday at Club 263. @bonganinkunzi&nbsp;
