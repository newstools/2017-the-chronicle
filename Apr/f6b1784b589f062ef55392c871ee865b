Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) have selected an 85-member squad to represent the country at the Confederation of School Sports Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) track and field tournament to be held at the National Sports Stadium from May 2-7. Zimbabwe will play host to Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana and Angola in the schools athletics event.Nash national head-in-charge of athletics Philip Chikomwe said all athletes booked their place in the squad following a Nash national track and field championship held at Lomagundi College in Chinhoyi last week. We had a very competitive meet with three provinces having the same number of gold medals so the winner was decided by the number of silver medals they won. This shows that there is a big improvement in terms of athletics in the country and we hope to continue with the standard. We had some new national records being set, particularly in the 17 years and under high jump, javelin and triple jump. We are yet to announce those records [and will do so] once they are verified, said Chikomwe.Harare were crowned the 2017 Nash national track and field champions after scooping 21 gold, 19 silver and 13 bronze medals. Masvingo emerged second with 21 gold, 13 silver and 12 bronze medals, followed by Mashonaland West with 21 gold, 10 silver and 10 bronze medals.Bulawayo came sixth, maintaining last year s position with nine gold, 11 silver and eight bronze medals. Matabeleland South were eighth with eight gold, 10 silver and 11 bronze, while Matabeleland North were second from last with four gold, eight silver and six bronze and Midlands came last with three gold, one silver and seven bronze.Chikomwe said the squad will go into camp on April 19 at Queen Elizabeth High School in Harare to prepare for the Cossasa championships.Province Gold Silver BronzeHarare 21 19 13 Masvingo 21 13 12 Mashonaland West 21 10 10 Mashonaland East 11 19 26 Mashonaland Central 10 4 1 Bulawayo 9 11 8 Manicaland 8 19 18 Matabeleland South 8 10 11 Matabeleland North 4 8 6 Midlands 3 1 7@khumzallen
