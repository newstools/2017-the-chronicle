Wynne Zanamwe, Midlands Reporter AN abusive Mvuma Assistant District Administrator has been ordered by a court to stop physically or verbally abusing his wife of 15 years who he often threatens to kill. Mvuma resident magistrate Mr Tayengwa Chibanda granted Ms Fadzai Basopo (age not given) the wife of Mvuma Assistant District Administrator Clemence Muduma (39) &#8211; a peace order against him.Ms Basopo in her affidavit told the court that Muduma was in the habit of physically and verbally abusing her in public and at home even in front of their children aged 11 and eight years.She said their traumatised children were now always crying. Ms Basopo said she had been forced to approach the courts to stop her husband from abusing or threatening to kill her. I was an accounts clerk at Kwekwe High school and when I quit my job in 2015 to stay at home, Muduma started abusing me. I want him to stop abusing me and my children in any way possible, be it physically, verbally or emotionally, said Ms Basopo. He always harasses or yells at me even when I use our vehicle and I want him to stop because it s an indirect way of refusing to let me use our property. I ask this honourable court to grant me a protection order so that he stops abusing me and my children or selling our property without my knowledge. He must release all the title deeds he hid. He once assaulted me all over the body and I ended up being hospitalised, he even threatens to kick me out of the house and uses abusive language in front of our children. The Magistrate granted the protection order.@wynnezane
