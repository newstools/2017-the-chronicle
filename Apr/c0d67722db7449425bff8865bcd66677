Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter PARTICIPANTS from South Africa and Botswana are expected to take part in the Bulawayo Table Tennis Association (BTTA) open tournament to be held at Queens Sports Club from today and tomorrow. BTTA chairperson Luba Ndlovu said 100 school children and 50 adults have confirmed their participation in the competition.He said competitors will battle in seven categories which include, Under-10, Under-12, Under-15, Under-18, Under-21, veteran and open section. We are expecting to start the year with a big event that is why we have invited individuals from our neighbouring countries to enhance the level of competition. I want to invite all those who are interested in the sport to come and witness the best players in action. BBTA is also geared up to start a league anytime in April as we are awaiting confirmation from other tertiary institutions, said Ndlovu.Ndlovu also called upon schools and tertiary institutions to introduce table tennis as that will help develop the sport in the country. This has been our main challenge because we don t have a strong base at grassroots level where children are introduced to the sport unlike other disciplines. We therefore encourage schools to introduce table tennis in their curriculum. Last year we had a coaching clinic facilitated by local and international trainers and this year we will also initiate an umpiring and officiating course, Ndlovu said. @khumzallen
