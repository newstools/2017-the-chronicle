It looks like 2017 is going to be another good year for rapper Nasty C. The Mabala Noise artist is leading the nominees for the 2017 South African Music Awards (Samas) with a total of six nominations.The nominees were announced at Destiny Exclusive Hotel in Kempton Park in Johannesburg on Thursday evening ahead of the awards ceremony taking place at the Sun City Superbowl on May 27.The Hell Naw hit-maker s debut album has been nominated in the Best Rap Album, Best Music Video, Album of the Year, Best Male Artist, and Best Newcomer categories.Nasty C walked away with four awards at the Metro FM Music Awards in February and will be hoping to add to his awards cabinet with his latest nominations. His debut album, Bad Hair Extensions, earned him nods for Sama Best Newcomer of the Year, Best Male Artist of the Year, Best Album of the Year and Best Rap Album. His videos Don t Do It and Good Girls are in the running for Best Music Video of the Year.He tweeted his excitement after the nominations were announced. God comes through every-single-time. Not far behind is rapper Kwesta, who bagged five nominations. Amanda Black is the third most nominated artist with four nods.Gospel singer Sfiso Ncwane, who passed away in December, received a nomination for Best Traditional Faith Music Album.Interestingly, Cassper Nyovest has once again given the Samas the cold shoulder by not entering his music for consideration. The rapper s fans have since inundated social media with a string of questions and speculation over why their icon had not bagged any nods.When called for comment yesterday, Cassper s manager, Tlee Mmolawa said Cassper had not submitted his music for the same reason as last year.Cassper has previously shaded the awards, saying that he would not enter his work for consideration because he did not rate the Samas. I don t want to win a Sama anymore. I m good without them he said on social media last year.The submissions list for this year s event, which has been seen by TshisaLIVE confirmed that the Doc Shebeleza rapper did not submit his work for consideration.However, three songs featuring Cassper did appear on the list: his collaboration with rapper Kwesta, a collaboration with Major League and a Coke Studio production.Publicist for the Samas, Hloni Modise, dismissed any beef between the organisers and Cassper. What s misunderstood as beef is not with the Samas. Rather, the incident that has happened in the past was over some of the rules that the rapper did not agree with. The Samas exist to celebrate music, Modise said.Below is a full list of the 2017 Sama nomineesBest Newcomer of the YearSoul Kulture &#8211; Ngeliny ilangaBabes Wodumo &#8211; Gqom Queen Vol. 1Sketchy Bongo- UnmaskedNasty C &#8211; Bad Hair ExtentionsAmanda Black &#8211; AmazuluBest Album of the YearKwesta &#8211; Dakar IIBlack Motion &#8211; Ya BadimoAmanda Black &#8211; AmazuluNasty C &#8211; Bad Hair ExtentionsThandiswa &#8211; BeledeBest Duo/Group of the YearThe Soil &#8211; The SoilJaziel Brothers &#8211; Jaziel BrothersSoul Kulture &#8211; Ngeliny ilangaThe Parlotones &#8211; Trinkets Relics &amp; HeirloomsBlack Motion &#8211; Ya BadimoBest Female Artist of the YearLebo Sekgobela &#8211; RestoredBabes Wodumo &#8211; Gqom Queen Vol. 1Kelly Khumalo &#8211; My TruthAmanda Black &#8211; AmazuluThandiswa &#8211; BeledeBest Male Artist of the YearDr Tumi &#8211; Heart of a kingKwesta &#8211; Dakar IIMusa &#8211; MusaNasty C &#8211; Bad Hair ExtentionsNathi &#8211; Umbulelo WamBest Rock AlbumThe Sweet Resistance &#8211; Where There Is HopeLost &amp; Found &#8211; Lost &amp; FoundRichard Stirton &#8211; Middle GroundThe Parlotones &#8211; Trinkets, Relics &amp; HeirloomsAlbert Frost &#8211; The Wake UpBest Pop AlbumMatthew Mole &#8211; RunLocnville &#8211; Taste The WeekendGoodLuck &#8211; The Nature WithinSketchy Bongo &#8211; UnmaskedTiMO ODV &#8211; Origins (Digital Edition)Beste Pop Album4Werke &#8211; 4 WarmADAM &#8211; HoogtevreesDewald Wasserfall &#8211; Jy Is Die StormKurt Darren &#8211; Sal Jy Met My DansSnotkop &#8211; HKGKBest Adult Contemporary AlbumElvis Blue &#8211; OpticsHugh Masekela &#8211; No BordersMajozi &#8211; FireMango Groove &#8211; Faces to the SunMsaki &#8211; Zaneliza: How The Water MovesBeste Kontempor re Musiek AlbumAdam Tas &#8211; Patatas en PyptabakCoenie de Villiers &#8211; EmojiJoshua na die Re n &#8211; Die W reld Binne MyRefentse &#8211; My hart bly in n taalRicus Nel &#8211; Ouskool BoerseunBest African Adult AlbumDumza Maswana &#8211; MoloKelly Khumalo &#8211; My TruthNathi &#8211; Umbelelo WamNozipho &#8211; ThandoSoul Kulture &#8211; Ngeliny ilangaBest Alternative Music AlbumArno Carstens &#8211; Die Aandblom 13Chris Chameleon &#8211; FirmamentNative Young &#8211; KingsSomerfaan &#8211; Alien Boogie StuffTailor &#8211; Trust Part 1Best R&amp;B Soul Reggae AlbumAfrotraction &#8211; Love and respectAmanda Black &#8211; AmazuluBrenda Mtambo &#8211; So Much MoreKarabo &#8211; Matters of the heartTima Reece &#8211; 9Best Rap AlbumA Reece &#8211; ParadiseKhuli Chana &#8211; One SourceKwesta &#8211; Dakar IINasty C &#8211; Bad Hair ExtentionsStogie T &#8211; Stogie TBest Kwaito AlbumBabes Wodumo &#8211; Gqom Queen Vol. 1Bullistic &#8211; N.W.O (New World Order)Dr Malinga &#8211; GoodwillTaylor K &#8211; Paper ChaseTrademark &amp; Zinhle Ngidi &#8211; Trademark &amp; Zinhle NgidiBest Dance AlbumDJ Clock &#8211; The 5th tickBlack Motion &#8211; Ya BadimoDurbans Finest &#8211; Durbans Finest &#8211; ReloadedMobi Dixon &#8211; Live The MusicNaakMusiQ &#8211; Born to EntertainBest Traditional Faith Music AlbumDeborah Fraser &#8211; UhamboSfiso Ncwane &#8211; Wethembekile BabaSpirit Of Praise &#8211; Spirit Of Praise Vol.6Teboho &#8211; Nkutlwele BohlokoZaza &#8211; Blowing the horn of chronicleBest Contemporary Faith Music AlbumDr Tumi &#8211; Heart of a kingDr Tumi &#8211; Love and graceKhaya Mthethwa &#8211; The DawnLebo Sekgobela &#8211; RestoredWe Will Worship &#8211; MmusoBest Traditional Music AlbumCandy &#8211; Easy Come Easy GoDr Thomas Chauke Na Shinyori Sisters &#8211; Shimatsatsa No 34: XigangaMmaausi &#8211; Monna Oa SokelwaQadasi &amp; Maqhinga &#8211; Lashis IlangaShabalala Rhythm &#8211; Yebo NgiyavumaBest Maskandi AlbumImfez emnyama &#8211; Monalisaimithente &#8211; s yawuvala umlomoKhuzani &#8211; Inyoni yomthakathiShwi noMtekhala &#8211; Kwabhalwa etsheniThokozani Langa &#8211; AmabrazoBest Jazz AlbumDarren English &#8211; Imagine NationDave Reynolds &amp; Pops Mohamed &#8211; Live in GrahamstownNduduzo Makhathini with Umgidi Trio and One Voice Vocal Ensemble &#8211; Inner DimensionsSydney Mavundla &#8211; LuhamboThandiswa &#8211; BeledeClassical Instrumental AlbumBongani Radebe &#8211; Buyelekhaya Sax RenditionCharl du Plessis Trio &#8211; Baroqueswing Vol. IIImilonji KaNtu Choral Society &#8211; And Then I Heard A Voice by SJ KhosaThe Voice of Angels &#8211; The Voice of Angels Volume 2University of Pretoria &#8211; Love and WarBest Afro Pop AlbumJaziel Brothers &#8211; Jaziel BrothersMusa &#8211; MusaRobbie Malinga &#8211; Robbie MalingaThe Soil &#8211; The SoilVusi Nova &#8211; Vusi NovaAfrican Indigenous Gospel AlbumAmadodana Ase Wesile &#8211; Amadodana Ase WesileJerusalema E Ncha &#8211; Jerusalema E NchaLejwe la Motheo &#8211; Lejwe la MotheoLiving In Christ Legends &#8211; Living In Christ LegendsT.C.C.C.
