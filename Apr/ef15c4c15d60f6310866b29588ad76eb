Stephen MuzhingiNoel Munzabwa in Manzini, Swaziland ULTRA marathon runner Stephen Muzhingi broke back into the top 10 of the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon after clinching eighth place in his best time in five years. Muzhingi completed the 56km race in three hours 15 minutes and 47 seconds. This was about eight minutes slower than his time of 3:08:08 which won him the 2012 Two Oceans Marathon and catapulted him into the history books, as one of only two male athletes to hold both the Comrades Marathon and Two Oceans Marathon titles simultaneously.Derek Preiss is the only other runner who held both titles in 1975.Injuries took their toll on Muzhingi causing his form to dip, but his time has been improving giving him some hope of springing a surprise in the Comrades Marathon set for June.In 2008, Muzhingi clocked 3:15:28 and finished eighth, the same position he claimed on Saturday. He went on to finish third in the Comrades Marathon.Meanwhile, his countryman Mike Fokorani failed to defend the title he won in 2016 and finished outside the top 10. Collen Makaza of the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services was the best local runner in Saturday s race, finishing fourth in 3:12:17, which was just within three minutes of winner Lungile Gongqa.In the women s marathon Tabitha Tsatsa was the only Zimbabwean in the top 10, finishing eighth in 4:04:08.
