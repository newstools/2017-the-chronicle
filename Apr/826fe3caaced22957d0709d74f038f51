Mr Davis LutheSukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Plumtree Correspondent PLUMTREE Town Council is inviting investors to take up 25 000 square metres of land which has been reserved for a private hospital and a shopping mall. Town Secretary Mr Davis Dumezweni Luthe said 10 000 square metres had been allocated towards constructing the hospital while the remaining land was for a shopping complex. I would like to call upon investors who have an interest in taking up land that we have in the CBD. We have 10 000 square metres for a private hospital and 25 000 square metres for a shopping complex. Investors who have an interest can approach the council for arrangements and further details, said Mr Luthe.He said developing this land was crucial in bringing development to the town.Mr Luthe said the border town has one district hospital, which was servicing Plumtree Town, Bulilima and Mangwe Districts. He said an additional hospital would help improve service delivery in the health sector. This will greatly benefit residents from the town if another hospital is built in the border town. We are in the process of expanding Dingumuzi Clinic in a bid to augment hospital services, he said.Plumtree District Medical Officer, Dr Langalokusa Sibanda recently said the health institution was overwhelmed as it had to cater for a large population.He also noted that the hospital was under-resourced.A resident from Plumtree, Mrs Lucy Moyo, said the construction of a private hospital and a shopping complex would help ease challenges. We really need a private hospital in Plumtree as the district hospital doesn t offer all the services we need. As a result we have to travel to hospitals in Bulawayo for services like X-rays and some operations. With the private hospital we can be guaranteed all services under one roof. The shopping complex will also ensure that we have a wide variety of services. At the moment we don t have many options when buying goods as the shops are limited, she said.@DubeMatutu
