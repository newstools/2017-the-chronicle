Alistair Shingirai MukoseraAmanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter BUSINESS came to a standstill in Gweru yesterday as over 400 vehicles passed through the Central Business District (CBD) hooting with some mourners hanging from car doors as residents and friends of the late socialite Alistair Shingirai Mukosera took him to his final resting place at Mtapa cemetery. Alistair (30) a socialite and popular car dealer in the city succumbed to injuries he sustained when the car he was driving hit a pothole before overturning and rolling several times when he was coming from a friend s party on Monday night.Before his burial a convoy of mourners coming from his parents house in Ivene suburb passed through the CBD at around 11AM before the convoy stopped by Moonlight Shopping Centre along Fourth Street where Alistair and his friends used to hang out and conduct their business.His relatives and friends cried loudly at this point and motorists were forced to wait for up to 20 minutes as the convoy made stops along the road before heading to Mtapa cemetery.Alistair got a befitting send off from Gweru residents.At the cemetery, a family spokesperson who identified himself as Alistair s uncle, Mr Joseph Mukosera, said the socialite s friends and associates had arranged and paid for all funeral expenses. While we mourn the loss of our son, we are humbled and happy by the love shown by his friends who met all the funeral expenses, he said. I always thought that they were his friends by name but they have proved us wrong. As a family we are very grateful. His friend who is identified as T1 in a video of Alistair while on his deathbed at Gweru Provincial Hospital, Mr Tawanda Muyezwu, confirmed the viral recording was genuine.He, however, refused to disclose the name of the person who took the video. I was called as soon as the fire brigade team attended to my friend and we accompanied him to the Gweru Provincial Hospital. I m aware of the video that has gone viral but unfortunately I can t disclose the person who captured it, Mr Muyezwu said.He said he thought his friend was going to survive the crash at the time they shot the video. @amanda49
