Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter THE Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has described the education curriculum which was introduced earlier this year as exploitative and unworkable. The union s president Mr Obert Masaraure told The Chronicle on Friday that the new curriculum, introduced by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education was anti-poor. The new curriculum exposes the anti-poor education curriculum. Presently the system is sidelining rural learners. Our learners have to learn Information Communication Technology but there is no electricity in those areas. There is a need for laboratories for science subjects but we have none in rural areas, he said.Mr Masaraure said the new curriculum is not in sync with the Nziramasanga Commission recommendations. The learning areas in the new curriculum are not leaning on global competency. The seven learning areas do not have anything do to with national development. As a nation we want a new curriculum which will produce graduates who will be able to tackle the national challenges which we are facing, said Mr Masaraure.The new curriculum is exploitative as it is burdening the teachers, he said. @amanda49&nbsp;
