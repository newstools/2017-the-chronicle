We decided to answer the call from sungura fans that we d been ignoring for far too long. Both Madzibaba and Kumene have a huge following in the region and I m certain the events will be a success, said Asani.Quizzed if their Bulawayo gig will not be overshadowed by the numerous events lined up for the ongoing ZITF, Asani said theirs was for a different crowd. We re aware that during the last day of trade fair, there ll be many other shows in the city, but as organisers, we ve a specific target audience. We re confident that followers of Madzibaba and Kumene music as well as those attending the ZITF will come through to the show, he said.Asani said the entry charge for both shows is $5.&nbsp;
