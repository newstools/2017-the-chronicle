Martin SibandaShowbiz Reporter Martin Sibanda and his Ndolwane Super Sounds band are ready to launch their album, Konke Sizokulungisa. The album, which leaked weeks ago, is set to be launched at the Hillbrow Theatre in Johannesburg on Saturday before being brought to Bulawayo on May 6 at the Amphitheatre.A bonus track has been added onto the album which initially had six tracks to try and make up to fans for the leak. Following the leak of our un-mastered version, we decided to give our fans a surprise bonus package. I won t mention the name of the bonus track because it s a surprise package, said Sibanda.Artistes who were featured on the album include Clement Makokotsha Magwaza, Zinja Ziyamluma and Madlela Skhobokhobo.Sibanda urged followers to buy original copies as a way of supporting the band. Everything is in place for the album launches. Fans in SA must come prepared to buy the original and finished album with seven tracks and expect great performances by Amajongosi. Ndolwane branded T-shirts and caps will be on sale at the launch, said Sibanda.He said they were in the process of negotiating with Zimpapers to avail the album at their various outlets nationwide. It s our hope to partner Zimpapers so they, through their vendors assist us to sell the album so that we boost CD sales and distribution. We ve also engaged numerous clubs and bars across the country to help us fight piracy by selling our original CDs on our behalf.
