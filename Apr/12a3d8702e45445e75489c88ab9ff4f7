I wanted them to experience the soul music and good love songs, said Plaxedes.She said her upcoming album would have 12 diverse tracks.The last time the artiste released a song was in 2015. In the past two years, I ve been living life. In any case, I wasn t inspired to do anything about music. Last year, I then decided to go back to studio after seeing a bit of life and with that experience, I believe I ve something to share through music. She said the latest single was available online for free download. We re giving away Now I know for free. Fans can visit my website and send me an email and I ll send them the song.
