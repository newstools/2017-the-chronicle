Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter LIVE Castle Lager Premier Soccer League games will only be screened by digital television channel SuperSport after the licence issue is resolved. With 18 matches played already in the 2017 PSL campaign, there has been no sign of the broadcaster at matches, but the league insists that all is in order. Our contract with SuperSport is still running (and) this means that Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches will be broadcast on SuperSport this season as has been done in the previous seasons. We are currently processing the required licences with the relevant authorities, said Kudzayi Bare, the PSL commu-nications and media liaison officer.Last year some clubs called for a review of the PSL/SuperSport deal, saying it wasn t serving its intended purposes and alleged that it benefited individuals instead of clubs.The agent, who brokered the deal, was set to get 15 percent of the total annual amount, which stood at $105 000, while clubs would get $22 000 each.In South Africa, the league s broadcasting rights are worth R492 765 050 million, which is almost double the league sponsorship amount.Despite the banning of private camera persons at PSL matches, SuperSport doesn t provide delayed games or offer clubs recorded games for technical analysis and archival purposes.@skhumoyo2000
