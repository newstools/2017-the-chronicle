Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter TWO hundred players are battling it out at the Zimbabwe Easter Chess Open in Harare. The event, which is being sponsored by Kasparov Chess Foundation Africa, got underway on Good Friday and ends tomorrow.Clive Mphambela from the Zimbabwe Chess Federation (ZCF) said the competition is in two sections, the Open and Prestige categories.The Open section is being held at the Causeway POSB and the Prestige event at the Ambassador Hotel. There are 44 players competing in the Prestige section and 156 in the Open section. This is one of the top international events with a number of titled players participating. We also have players from Zambia and another player from Botswana taking part in this year s competition, said Mphambela. The contest has been going very well so far and we expect good performances from Zimbabweans who are eager to reclaim the Easter Open, which was won by Fide Master (FM) Andrew Kayonde of Zambia last year. The turnout has been amazing with 50 percent being schoolchildren and I believe that has also contributed to the tight competition, he said.Mphambela said the winner in the Prestige section will walk away with $1 350 while the winner in the Open section will pocket $1 000.Some top chess players competing in the event include South Africa-based International Master (IM) Rodwell Makoto, who is being supported by the Bulawayo trio of Candidate Master (CM) Dion James Moyo, Fide Master (FM) Sifiso Ncube, Castro Sibanda and Kudakwashe Sibanda from the National University of Science and Technology (Nust).Top Zimbabwean chess player Spencer Masango pulled out of the event after two rounds following a death in his family.Zambian International Master (IM) Chitumbo Mwali, (IM) Kelvin Chumfwa and Kela Kaulule Siame are competing, including Simon Bokamoso from Botswana.The Easter Chess Open is one of the major tournaments on the local chess calendar. @khumzallen
