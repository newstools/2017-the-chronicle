Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) board member John Falkenberg has urged the Zimbabwe Triathlon Association to grow the sport by taking it to public schools. Speaking at the awards dinner for the Bonaqua Troutbeck Africa Triathlon Union Triathlon Africa Cup awards ceremony in Nyanga on Saturday, Falkenberg said that out of the 59 sports associations registered with the SRC, there are only nine that are compliant in terms of governing matters, with triathlon being one of them. He commended the association s president Rick Fulton for the sterling job his organisation is doing. I would also like to acknowledge from the SRC board the great job that your team does Rick. Out of the 59 sports in Zimbabwe, there are only nine compliant sports bodies in Zimbabwe on governance issues and you are one of them, so I salute you for that, my board appreciates it. My challenge would be to your association to take the sport to Government schools. I know we had a few in the event, but let s take the sport to people who have never heard of triathlon and let s grow your sport, said Falkenberg.The former Zimbabwe Rugby Union president said triathlon, like any other sport, had not been spared by the harsh economic conditions in the country, but continues to do wonders with representation on the world stage.Despite being constituted in Zimbabwe in 1989, having started off in Bulawayo, triathlon remains a preserve of those with financial resources because of the expenses involved. A bicycle suitable for triathlon, for example, costs between $3 000 and $5 000.
