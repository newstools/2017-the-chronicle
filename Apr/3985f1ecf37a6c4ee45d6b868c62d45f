Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter FORTY schools will battle it out in the 2017 edition of the Schools Sports Rugby Festival at Hartsfield Grounds today and tomorrow. Formerly known as the Power Sales Rugby Festival, the Matabeleland Rugby Football Board-organised competition is the first pre-season event and has over the years attracted schools from South Africa and Botswana. One of the event organisers Themba Phiri said they are expecting fireworks in this year s competition. All is set for the annual event and we had a number of teams confirming their participation. There are teams from Masvingo, Harare, Bulawayo and we have also invited other teams from Botswana, which shows the magnitude of this event. Fireworks are expected especially in the local derby between Milton High and Petra High. The last time these two met, Petra beat Milton for the first time in 10 years. We know Milton will be looking for revenge so this is one of the matches fans must look out for, said Phiri.Some schools which will compete in the event include Allan Wilson High, Churchill High, Gifford High, Milton High, Petra High, Plumtree High, Prince Edward, Morgan High, Wise Owl Group of Schools, St Bernard s High, St Columba s High, Sobukhazi High, Northlea High, Msiteli High, Inyanda Secondary, Goromonzi High and Entumbane High.The Schools Sports Rugby Festival takes place annually on the first weekend of the April school holiday. Its aim is to give pre-season game time to players ahead of the season. @khumzallen.
