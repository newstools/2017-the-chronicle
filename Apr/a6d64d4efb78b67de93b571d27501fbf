Ambassador Mary MubiPamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) is participating at the ZITF to showcase a coordinated approach to industrial development and its value chains. Senior principal director in the OPC, Ambassador Mary Mubi says the objective of the exhibition is to increase coordination and coherence by ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are involved at the appropriate stages of industrial development. We re excited to be at the ZITF to demonstrate Government s commitment to transform the socio-economic fabric. The ZITF gives us an opportunity to provide a strategic overview of the importance of a Whole of Government Approach in industrial development activities, including a foresight function aimed at identifying stakeholders and building anticipatory capacity. It also allows us to communicate Government successes and actions towards the achievement of industry related goals under Zim-Asset as well as assess the impact of Government initiatives on industry and citizens, said Amb Mubi.She said through the exhibition, the OPC is focusing on the promotion and awareness creation of existing policies, programmes, strategies and activities housed in different ministries and departments that endorse industrial development.Amb Mubi added that the OPC also expected to enhance public acceptance of strategically planned and executed marketing and public relations activities for industrial development and poverty eradication. We re also looking forward to receiving contributions from the public for active Zim-Asset linkages, synergies and relationships for economic growth and social transformation. There s also active promotion of conditions for sustainable industrialisation such as research and development, infrastructure and utilities, energy supply, transport, ICT, employment and labour legislation, ease of doing business, small and medium enterprise support, industrialisation and rural development, capacity building, indigenisation and empowerment, gender in industrial development, value chains, finance, education and skills and raw materials. Achieving internal and external communication, Amb Mubi added, is another objective for exhibiting in an effort to support industrial development, through information dissemination, advocacy messages to ZITF publics.Amb Mubi said the OPC was operating under four thematic areas, which include financing for industrial development, industry, infrastructure, utilities and enablers, research and development, innovation and technology, policy framework and governance and the human capital development, skills and labour.She called for a collective approach towards achieving these outcomes adding that the revival of the economy requires joint action. Our desire is to ensure the horizontal and vertical co-ordination of government activities in order to improve policy coherence, better use of resources, promote and capitalise on synergies and innovation that arise from a multi-stakeholder perspective, and provide seamless service delivery to citizens and businesses. This requires government bodies, regardless of type or level, to work across portfolio boundaries to achieve shared goals and to provide integrated government responses to policy issues. The approach provides ease of access and better understanding of the linkages and relationships, said Amb Mubi.The OPC is coordinating the implementation of the five-year economic blueprint, working closely with different stakeholders drawn from both public and private sectors.The Zim-Asset strategy was crafted to achieve sustainable development and social equity anchored on indigenisation, empowerment and employment creation, which will be largely propelled through judicious exploitation of the country s abundant human and natural resources.This results-based agenda is built around four strategic clusters that are meant to enable Zimbabwe to achieve economic growth and reposition the country as one of the strongest economies in the region and Africa.The four strategic clusters are: food security and nutrition; social services and poverty eradication; infrastructure and utilities and value addition and beneficiation.
