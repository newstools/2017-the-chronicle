Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Tug-of-War Federation (ZITWF) have taken their begging bowl to the corporate world for financial assistance to host this year s Africa Tug-of-War Championships in July. Zimbabwe got the offer to host the competition after winning the 2016 Africa Championships held in Zambia.ZITWF secretary-general Sifelumusa Dube said: This is an offer that we can t miss as a country due to the fact that we are the defending champions. If we fail to host this competition, it will be given to other countries and we wouldn t want that because we need our home crowd to help us defend the title. Once we let this opportunity slip away, we might not get another chance again. So we are appealing to anyone that can assist us. He said the national executive will meet on Friday to discuss the way forward. If we fail to find a sponsor, this competition might move to South Africa meaning there will be two combined events there. The other event is the club championships, said Dube.Clubs from the ZITWF were invited to participate in the South African Open Tug-of-War Championships that were held in Kimberly in June, 2016.
