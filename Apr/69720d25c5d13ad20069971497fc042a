Chronicle Reporter A TOTAL of 15 show societies in the country have formed the National Association of Agricultural Show Societies of Zimbabwe (NAASSZ) to enhance the country s agriculture industry through active participation by stakeholders. Zimbabwe Agricultural Society (ZAS) head of programmes and public affairs Ms Roberta Katunga said NAASSZ would be officially launched in Harare early next month. Fourteen show societies in Zimbabwe have come together to form a National Association of Agricultural Show Societies, a move aimed at creating a platform to enhance the country s agriculture sector through active participation by stakeholders. The association, which will be officially launched on May 5, 2017 at the RM Centre, Exhibition Park, is a non-profit and apolitical organisation whose aim is to raise standards of the sector, she said.The show societies include ZAS, Victoria Falls Agricultural Show, Bulawayo Agricultural Society, Matabeleland South Agricultural Show Society, Mazowe Valley Agricultural Society, Midlands, Chipinge, Chinhoyi, Hwange, Chegutu, Lowveld, Mashonaland East, Kadoma Show Societies as well as Manicaland Agric Show Society and Masvingo Provincial Show Society.Ms Katunga said raising standards would be done through instilling into NAASSZ membership the core values of integrity, punctuality, fairness, accountability, general standards of best practice and teamwork between organisers, venue providers, service providers and their sub-contractors.This, she said, implies the delivery of the latest products and services using internationally accepted techniques.Ms Katunga said NAASSZ was formed to guide its members in attaining international standards of operation and service delivery to enhance their image anchored on creating awareness in the industry of the importance of subscribing to the association.It is hoped that the formation of the association will allow the Harare Agriculture Show to draw exhibitors from provinces to promote national representation of the best in the sector.Ms Katunga alluded to ZAS chief executive officer Dr Anxious Masuka s sentiments that the coming together of the show societies would enable NAASSZ to regularise through discussion the way members operate within Zimbabwe. The association will provide a networking platform for its members to develop a closer relationship and understanding between the event organiser, the venue and service providers for the benefit of their respective clients in matters of common interest while promoting cohesion in decision making and creating partnerships that will foster mutual respect, set and maintain quality standards and high levels of professionalism among individuals and organisations that wish to offer services to the industry, said Dr Masuka.
