Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ELEVEN local coaches instructors will undergo a two-day refresher course at the Zifa Village in Harare today and tomorrow. The instructors attending the course include Gibson Homela, Samson Mavhenyengwa, Tafadzwa Mashiri, Sithethelelwe Sibanda, Rosemary Mugadza, Oscar Mazhambe, Benedict Moyo, Bheki Nyoni, Clement Bonda, James Muhala and Richard Tswatswa.Newly appointed Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede, Tawurayi Mangwiro and Nelson Matongorere are the course facilitators.Speaking to Zifa s official website, Mutekede underscored the importance of the refresher course in an ever-evolving football world. The refresher course comes at a time when we are moving to be in sync with ever changing trends in the football world. As is the norm in every industry, personnel are taken through periodical refresher programmes in order to keep them abreast with current trends, Mutekede said.He said emphasis will be on the domestic instructorship programmes.The refresher course comes at a time when Zifa is embarking on a move to hold nine Caf Licence courses across the country after being given the go ahead by the continental football governing body.The courses on offer are Caf C and Caf B, with a bias towards former national team players.Homela told Chronicle Sport yesterday that the refresher course is meant to equip coaches instructors ahead of the Caf Licence courses. This is a very important course to us as coaches instructors considering the work ahead of us. We are going there to learn ways of going about the courses. The assumption is that when we go out to the field, instructors might do different things, so through this refresher course, we are coming together as a formidable unit to be armed with the right skills and knowledge on how to go about the courses. After the refresher course, we must be able to illustrate and even demonstrate certain things to our students in more vivid ways, Homela said.@khumzallen
