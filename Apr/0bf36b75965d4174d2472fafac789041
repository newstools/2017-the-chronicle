Kelvin KainduRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FIVE Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches will be played over the Easter holidays after four games were postponed to allow for the staging of the Independence Cup. Matches cancelled are the Chicken Inn-FC Platinum, Dynamos-Black Rhinos, Harare City-Highlanders and ZPC Kariba-Caps United encounters.FC Platinum, Dynamos, Highlanders and Caps United are set to play in the Independence Cup semi-finals on Sunday, with the final set for the National Sports Stadium on Tuesday.The PSL Easter programme starts on Good Friday with Shabanie Mine hoping to continue with their fine start that has seen them collecting four out of a possible six from their opening two games, when they host Bulawayo City.Shabanie are fourth on the table, two points behind Ngezi Platinum Stars, and a victory for Shabanie will see them moving to the top of the table for 24 hours awaiting the outcome of the Ngezi and How Mine encounter.What makes the Shabanie and Bulawayo City game even more interesting is that the Zvishavane side will want to beat City, coached by Mandla Mpofu, who dumped them for the municipal side when a deal seemed sealed.Bulawayo City should expect a tough encounter against Shabanie, who held Caps United to a 0-0 draw at Maglas in their season s opener.Shabanie went on to pick maximum points on the road, beating Highlanders 1-0 at Barbourfields Stadium, a result that probably further boosted their confidence.However, outgoing Shabanie coach Wilson Mutekede warned his players against complacency following convincing performances against Caps United and Highlanders. The danger is that after such a good start over confidence creeps in and it s something they have to work on. Having beaten Highlanders and collected a point from the defending champions, the danger is that the players might think they have everything covered yet they need to continue working hard, Mutekede said.Shabanie are racing against time to get Mutekede s replacement as their technical manager Taku Shariwa can t bark instructions from the bench because he does not have a Caf A Licence to coach a PSL side.City, on the other hand, will be hoping to make it two wins in a row. City bounced back from their 0-2 loss to Highlanders in the opening game to beat Chicken Inn 2-1. The other match set for Good Friday is the Tsholotsho FC and Yadah FC encounter to be played at Dulivhadzimu Stadium in Beitbridge.Both sides are yet to register defeats, with Tsholotsho sitting on 12th position with two points, while Yadah are fifth with four points, two behind leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars.The postponement of the four matches presents leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars with a chance to stretch their lead.Ngezi are at home to How Mine, who are searching for their first win on Saturday, the same day Chapungu and Hwange clash in Gweru.On Easter Monday, Bantu Rovers and Triangle United meet at Luveve Stadium to complete the PSL holiday programme.Match Day Three fixturesFriday, April 14: Shabanie Mine v Bulawayo City (Maglas), Tsholotsho FC v Yadah FC (Dulivhadzimo)Saturday, April 15: Ngezi Platinum v How Mine (Baobab), Chapungu v Hwange (Ascot)Monday, April 17: Bantu Rovers v Triangle United (Luveve)TableP W D L GF GA GD Pts Ngezi Platinum 2 2 0 0 4 0 4 6 FC Platinum 2 2 0 0 4 2 2 6 Caps United 2 1 1 0 2 1 1 4 Shabanie Mine 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 4 Yadah FC 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 4 Chicken Inn 2 1 0 1 6 2 4 3 Highlanders 2 1 0 1 2 1 1 3 Black Rhinos 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 3 ZPC Kariba 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 3 Bulawayo City 2 1 0 1 2 3 -1 3 Triangle United 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 Tsholotsho FC 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 Dynamos 2 0 1 1 2 3 -1 1 Chapungu 2 0 1 1 0 1 -1 1 Harare City 2 0 1 1 1 2 -1 1 How Mine 2 0 1 1 1 2 -1 1 Hwange 2 0 1 1 0 3 -3 1 Bantu Rovers 2 0 0 2 2 8 -6 0 @ZililoR
