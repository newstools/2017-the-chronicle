Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter REDCLIFF town council has resolved to ration water and charge every household a flat fee of $20 a month regardless of the water consumed as it battles to clear a $9 million water debt. The council which is supplied water by Kwekwe City Council, has not been paying its water bill resulting in its neighbour cutting supplies.Redcliff mayor Clr Fred Kapuya said following a meeting with residents, it was agreed that each house will pay a flat fee of $20 for water each month.Clr Kapuya said council had an obligation to pay the outstanding debt as well as the present bill.The mayor said a revenue officer and a municipal police officer will soon be moving from door to door collecting the $20 for water. Residents long stopped paying for water hence this decision to collect the money from each household every month, he said.Clr Kapuya said they were planning to install prepaid water metres and residents were in support of the project. We are looking forward to the installation of the prepaid metres as soon as we finish the project to upgrade the water reticulation system, said Clr Kapuya.Kwekwe council recently resumed supplies to the mining town as it feared an outbreak of diseases. @amanda49.
