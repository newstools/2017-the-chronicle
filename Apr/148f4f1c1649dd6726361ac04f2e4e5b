Milton High School boys tussle for possession during a schools rugby tournament played at Hartsfield Stadium in Bulawayo yesterdayAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE 2017 edition of the Schools Sports Rugby Festival kicked off at Hartsfield grounds in Bulawayo yesterday. One of the event organisers, Themba Phiri, said the first day of the competition kicked off on a high note with an interesting Bulawayo derby pitting Milton and Petra High schools.Milton won the match 10-5. Everything went well on day one and we are hoping that the final day (today) of the competition will be even more interesting. We had a slow start as schools were not able to access their monies from the banks so the competition delayed a little bit. However, looking at the performance on the field it was great because we had players who will be representing the country in Madagascar next week so the competition was tough. We were also graced by the presence of the national team coach which increased the level of competition as the youngsters tried to impress him, said Phiri.He said fireworks are expected in today s matches with some interesting matches to look out for. The teams have been paired strength to strength so we don t expect anything less than the clash of the country s rugby giants. I just want to urge all the fans to come and witness this annual event as teams gear up for the 2017 rugby season, Phiri said.Yesterday s resultsUnder 16: Milton 46-5 St Bernards, Gifford 0-17 St Columbus, Allan Wilson 17-5 Petra, Churchill 17-3 Plumtree, Entumbane 5- 12 Nkulumane, Northlea (girls) 5-5 Msiteli (girls)Under 19: Entumbane 12-27 Northlea, Msiteli 8- 22 Churchill, St Columbus 12-0 Hamilton, Allan Wilson 48-0 Gifford, Churchill 52-0 Plumtree, Milton 10-5 Petra.Today s fixturesField A under-19: St Columbus v Hamilton, Northlea v Amhlophe, Northlea v Msiteli, Churchill v Entumbane, Gifford v St. Bernards, Plumtree v Kwekwe, Petra v Allan Wilson, Churchill v Milton.Field B under-16: Entumbane v St. Bernards, Allan Wilson v Nkulumane, Petra v St Columbus, Msiteli (girls) v Northlea (girls), Churchill v Milton, Msitheli (girls) v Amhlophe (girls), Gifford v Plumtree, Kwekwe v Entumbane&nbsp;
