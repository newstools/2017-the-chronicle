Rahman GumboSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter CHICKEN Inn coach Rahman Gumbo has refused to be carried away by their demolition of neighbours Bantu Rovers in a Castle Lager Premiership season opener on Saturday, saying his immediate aim now was to win the first five games. The first game is already done and dusted and Bulawayo City are their next opponents on Saturday before they play host to FC Platinum in Week 3.The Gamecocks then leave Bulawayo for the first time this season in Week 4 to face Triangle United at Gibbo Stadium and wrap up their fifth game at home to Premiership returnees Black Rhinos. The aim now is to win the first five games and then we will take it from there. We are not looking at the title yet, lest we put ourselves under unnecessary pressure because we still have 33 more games to play, said Gumbo.He is one of the most successful local coaches in club football having lifted three league titles in three different countries.Critics though might say the Bantu Rovers game cannot be used as a barometer to measure the former champions credentials because the Methembe Ndlovu coached outfit are still green, having been promoted this season.However, the world over derbies are well known for totally disregarding present form as the players are naturally motivated to outdo each other for the bragging rights until their next encounter.The Gamecocks were the opening weekend s biggest scorers, hitting five past Ndodana Sibanda in goal for Bantu Rovers.Newly signed Chicken Inn midfielder Innocent Mucheneka scored the first and fastest Match Day One league goal in the 18th minute. Striker Ishmael Lawe came off the bench in the second half to become the first player in 2017 to score a brace.Obidiah Tarumbwa and Tafadzwa Kutinyu were also on target for the Gamecocks.
