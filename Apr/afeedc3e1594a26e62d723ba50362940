Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent CRITICAL parts to the newly acquired $100 000 dialysis machine at Masvingo General Hospital which went missing in January this year in a suspected theft case have been found. The theft was discovered by a Chinese engineer who had come to install the machine.In an interview yesterday, Masvingo Provincial Medical Director (PMD) Dr Amadeaus Shamu said the parts resurfaced in a storeroom last week.He said indications are that the parts &#8211; a pump to the dialysis unit plus its components could have been stripped, only for the culprit to sneak them back after realising the seriousness of the matter.He said despite the recovery of the missing parts, investigations are continuing and heads will obviously roll. I can confirm that the missing dialysis machine parts were found in the store room last week. We have since notified the police over the matter as we had made an official report when the parts went missing, said Dr Shamu.He said the surprising thing is that the missing parts were found in the storeroom yet a number of staff members had thoroughly searched the room. There is no corner in the storeroom that was left unchecked. We suspect there is foul play. Heads will roll once the staff member is found. Despite the good news, we will continue investigating, he said.Dr Shamu said the machine has already been installed after the Ministry of Health and Child Care replaced the missing parts but the machine is yet to start working.He said plans to send some nurses for training on how to operate the machine are at an advanced stage.The dialysis machine was procured under a $100 million government agreement signed between China and Zimbabwe and this will see all 10 provincial hospitals getting the critical machine.The installation of a dialysis machine at Masvingo General Hospital has brought relief to renal patients who cannot afford private medical services or travel to Harare or Bulawayo to access services from public hospitals.@walterbmswazie3
