Mavuthela had two wives and 23 children with Nyathi being the first born in a family of 10 children from the first wife. My father used to buy goods from villages for resale in Bulawayo in order to fend for his family. I grew up as a herd boy and there were times when I d sleep in the pen with the goats mainly because the goat s droppings would be warm, Nyathi once said. At times it d be because the goats would ve strayed and got lost, the result of which would be a hiding. No one in my village ever thought that I d grow up to be a sensible man that I think I am now. I never liked school then and most of the time I d get beaten for not attending school. Mourners are gathered at 13137, Nkulumane 12 in Bulawayo.
