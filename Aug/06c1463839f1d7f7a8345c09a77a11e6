We grew up listening and singing along to her music and now, I ll be on stage with her, which is a dream come true for some of us, said Ndebele.She said she will perform new songs and others from yesteryear.Ncube s latest album Usiko was recorded by Tenth District Music in Bulawayo.Since the 80s, early in her career where she contributed to the iconic band Ilanga, Ncube has forged ahead strongly in her career, with her music moving people and receiving acclaim both at home and abroad.She has been received well in Europe where she proudly carries the Zimbabwean flag.
