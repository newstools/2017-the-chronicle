Musa Mandaza Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region has plunged into a fix in its bid to resolve the outstanding ZPC Hwange and ZRP Bulawayo Province rescheduled league match, with the police side refusing to pay referees for the cancelled game. In April, ZRP Bulawayo failed to travel for their league match against the power generators because they were on national duty. Zifa Southern Region tried to force them to fulfil a league fixture on Independence Day when their players, who are serving police officers, were on national duty. ZRP Bulawayo did not travel to Hwange resulting in Zifa awarding the game to the power generators on a 3-0 score line and fining the police side $500 in accordance with Article 9.4 of its rules and regulations. However, ZRP Bulawayo got a “temporary reprieve” when the Zifa Southern Region disciplinary committee reversed a decision to award the game ZPC Hwange and rescheduled it. Despite being found not guilty of failing to travel to Hwange, ZRP Bulawayo were ordered to cater for match day costs, which include paying match officials, ground rentals and hiring of police. ZRP Bulawayo rejected the move, saying Zifa Southern Region should shoulder the costs for scheduling the game on Independence Day  fully aware that the police side won’t be available. Their argument is based on the precedence set last year when ZRP Hwange failed to fulfil a match against Bantu Rovers because of work related commitments and Zifa ordered the same referees, who had been paid for the game to take charge of the rescheduled fixture. “Our appeal was against paying the $500 fine for the walkover and losing three points because we were on duty of which we communicated to Zifa. Please note that we’re not at war with these guys, but it’s their mistake and they have to sort it out. “We want to have faith in the system, but the judgment was harsh. We don’t mind losing points, but to cater for costs that the home team should carry is not fair. Why don’t the referees or service providers that were paid money for a job that they didn’t do be assigned for the rescheduled game. “On Wednesday we were summoned by Zifa Southern Region, who told us they wanted to reschedule the fixture and we told them we will only cater for our travelling expenses and nothing more. We’re meeting as an executive and will write to them and they should be having our letter by Friday,” said ZRP Bulawayo vice-chairman Fiso Siziba. Zifa Southern Region chairman Musa Mandaza insists ZRP Bulawayo should pay. “Everything related to the ZPC Hwange-ZRP Bulawayo game is under control and the office will be working on that match. The disciplinary committee’s decision was clear that ZRP Bulawayo were going to pay. That case is water under the bridge, it’s a case that has already been dealt with and it’s a chapter that is closed. As an executive, we can’t overturn the decision of the disciplinary committee,” Mandaza said. The second half of the Southern Region Division One League resumes tomorrow with ZRP Bulawayo clashing with Zim Leopards at White City Stadium. ZPC Hwange will be hoping to close the gap between them and log leaders Bulawayo Chiefs, who are on a bye, when they take on Indlovu Iyanyathela. Chiefs are on 27 points, 13 ahead of ZPC Hwange.
