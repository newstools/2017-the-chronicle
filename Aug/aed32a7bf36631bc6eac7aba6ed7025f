The court heard that the dagga has an estimated street value of $360. I am possessed by ancestral spirits and I follow what they tell me to do. Some time last month they instructed me, in a dream, to grow and sell mbanje andI acquired the 360 grammes from a man in Gweru for $10, said Ncube.The magistrate asked Ncube what kind of spirits led him to commit a crime and he said his ancestors had warned him about his arrest, hence he already knew what his sentence would be.

On August 16, detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Drugs received information that the accused person was in possession of dagga.
