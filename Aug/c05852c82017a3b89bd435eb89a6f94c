Amanda NkomoBongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent IT S been a long time coming and rising gospel star Amanda Nkomo feels this is the right time for her to step out of the shadows and launch her solo career through a single titled Bhera Rorira.

I feel it s about time I come out of my cocoon. I started singing at primary school and from there, I ve been working with different artistes like Takesure, Thembani Dube, Creme Voices and I felt that at some point in my life, I should give it a shot and this is the time, said AmandaGrace.Her new single, a praise song, has been one year in the making after she was voted the best female singer during the HHIC Clash of the hub choirs. I gave this song my best and one of my fears now is what will the listeners think about it. But then again that s art, that s music. She is, however, confident that everything will go well as she has the blessing from the Almighty. While I m nervous, I believe I m under grace because I ve seen the favour of God in my life I know I do not deserve, said AmandaGrace.The song will be available at HHIC, Inno8te, Haddon &amp; Sly and also on iTunes.AmandaGrace, after the release of Bhera Rorira, will conclude work on an upcoming album she hopes to release in December.
