Councillor Charles Moyo (36) of Ward 9, who is from the MDC-T party, yesterday appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube charged with sending a message that is grossly offensive, indecent or of an obscene nature through a cellphone.The ward encompasses Mpopoma, Matshobana and Kelvin North 2.Mr Ncube remanded Moyo out of custody on free bail to today for trial, following his plea to seek legal representation.Prosecuting, Ms Margaret Takawira said on July 14 Moyo sent obscene messages to the Mpopoma-Matshobana Residents Executive Committee WhatsApp group.The group was set up to allow community members to communicate with their councillor on matters of development.The pornographic gutter language used in the messages is so crude that it cannot be printed in a family paper. On July 14 at around 10AM the accused sent a message with a grossly, offensive, indecent and obscene character using his cellphone line number 0772 431 750, said Ms Takawira. Some of the group members were not pleased with the post. In a statement to the police, Mr Jifile Dube, a member of the committee said he reported the matter to the police because he did not expect such an offensive message from a leader. I was surprised to receive such an offensive, obscene and indecent message from a respectable member of our community, said Mr Dube. I really felt offended by the accused s messages and made a report to the police. @NyarieBakie
