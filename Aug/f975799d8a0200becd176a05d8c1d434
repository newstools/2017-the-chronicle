Since 1980, the institution they conceptualised and established has not only stood the test of time, but also grown from strength to strength. I am happy that some of the founding fathers are still with us and they continue to be a valuable source of wisdom for Sadc and future generations to come. The summit is running under the theme: Partnering with the private sector in developing industry and regional value-chains.
