The choirs have grown tremendously from when I was here four years ago. I had the opportunity to nurture them and was blown away by their talent, said Mkhize. I d like to work with these four choirs who I m convinced are the best Harvest House has to offer. He encouraged HICC to treasure the music churned out by choirs describing it as liquid gold. The level of creativity is liquid gold and it s very important that we keep that and make sure it belongs to the church. Although the final four were singing gospel music, they re very diverse in style and presentation, said Mkhize.It was a double celebration for uprising gospel star AmandaGrace, a member of WTU who successfully launched her solo career through a single Bhera Rorira.The HHIC Clash of Hub Choirs was the grand finale of the annual church s Apostolic/Prophetic Conference that ran from August 24 to August 27 under the theme: Church Planting, Church Growth .@bonganinkunzi
