Revelations of you has three stages including revelations of God, revelations of people in general and revelations of relationships. It basically explores human nature. Though the artiste is nervous to host her first solo show, she said she was excited. I m very nervous and excited at the same time. I don t know if a lot of people will come out and support me or if it s going to work out but the essence of the whole show is to start something. All big artistes started somewhere, said Lady Tshawe.To make the show even more intriguing, guest artistes including So Profound and DeLukes are set to perform some of Lady Tshawe s works.So Profound said he was upbeat. I m so excited to be sharing the stage, not only with a friend, but such a phenomenal artiste who I ve known for a while now and always admired her work.This is her first solo, something which signifies growth, not just as an artiste, but in an industry that s somewhat dying, he said. I urge people to come in numbers and be part of Lady Tshawe s journey.
