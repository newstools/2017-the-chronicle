Minister Wang YiBeijing China is telling the US and North Korea to hit the brakes on threatening words and actions and work toward a peaceful resolution of their dispute, in a sign of growing concern over the standoff on the part of Pyongyang s only major ally. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to stir up an incident on their doorstep , according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry s website. The most important task at hand is for the US and North Korea to hit the brakes on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an August crisis, Wang was quoted as saying in the Tuesday conversation.The ministry quoted Lavrov as saying tensions could rise again with the US and South Korea set to launch large-scale military exercises on August 21. A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods, Lavrov was quoted as saying.China is North Korea s main economic partner and political backer, although relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated amid the North s continuing defiance of China s calls for restraint.In recent months, China has joined with Russia in calling for the US to suspend annual military exercises with South Korea in exchange for Pyongyang halting its missile and nuclear tests as a first step toward direct talks.Yesterday, the chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, continued a visit to China following talks the day before with his Chinese counterpart that touched on North Korea. No details of the talks have been released.Dunford on Tuesday told Fang Fenghui, chief of the People s Liberation Army s joint staff department, that the sides had many difficult issues between them, but were willing to deal with them through dialogue.On Monday, Dunford was in Seoul to meet with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media, seeking to ease anxiety while showing his willingness to back President Donald Trump s warnings if need be.The US wants to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea, but Washington is also ready to use the full range of its military capabilities, Dunford said.His visit to Asia, which also will include a stop in Japan, comes after Trump last week declared the US military locked and loaded and said he was ready to unleash fire and fury if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.
