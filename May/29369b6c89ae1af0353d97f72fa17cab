I got the sad news while I was on my way to Russia. It s sad that Cde Ndlovu has passed on. I was with him two weeks ago trying to assist him and the family but when the time has come no one can stop it. He had his time and we re happy to celebrate his life as one of the most senior people in the struggle. We worked together very well, said VP Mphoko.He said Cde Ndlovu was a good family friend who was present when he married his wife Laurinda in Mozambique in the 1970s. For my family, Cde Ndlovu was a good friend. I knew him well because he used to come to my home before I went to war. He was sent from Lusaka to officiate at my wedding with South Africa s President, Jacob Zuma. It s a pity we ve lost him but we re proud of him because he leaves a legacy of loyalty, hard work and a life free from controversy. These are important qualities required in any true cadre. Some people choose to be controversial but Cde Ndlovu was not. When he died he was the selfless Cde Ndlovu that we always knew from long back. May God bless his soul, said VP Mphoko.He comforted Cde Ndlovu s family saying the nation was with them during this difficult time.@pamelashumba1
