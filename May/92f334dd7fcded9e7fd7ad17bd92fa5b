Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A MAN from Beitbridge was allegedly robbed of $950 and a cell phone at knife point by a pirate taxi driver and his accomplice. Mr Kenneth Kunze (31) of Granite area hired a pirate taxi, popularly known as mshika-shika, from Engen Garage around 1 AM sometime last week.The driver and a passenger allegedly robbed him after travelling a few kilometres, between Mashakada and Mashavire Business centres.Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the robbery.He said the suspects were still at large. I can confirm that we received a report of two men who robbed a passenger of more than $900 at knife point. They fled from the scene and investigations are underway, said Insp Ndebele.He warned members of the public against boarding pirate taxis as well as walking around with large amounts of money. Members of the public must stop boarding unlabelled taxis or private cars as they risk their lives. They also need to stop moving around with large sums of money as they attract thieves who may injure or kill them during robbery, said Insp Ndebele.A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr Kunze got in and found a male passenger with the driver. Kunze boarded the pirate taxi which had two unknown people who later robbed him. As they were halfway to his home, between Mashakada and Mashavire Business Centres, the passenger produced an okapi knife, pressed it to his throat and demanded cash. Fearing for his life, he sat still as the driver suddenly stopped the car in the middle of the bush. The driver searched his pockets and took $950 and a cell phone, said the source.The source said Kunze was unfortunate, probably because the robbers knew he had money on him. Otherwise the mshika-shikas are our popular mode of transport although they are not safe, the source added.@winnie_masara
