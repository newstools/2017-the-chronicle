I was personally assigned by the President and it s unfortunate that it s premature to reveal everything now. However, I m ready for the forum together with the ministers, the ambassador and a few business people who have come with us. We ll all do our best for the country in strengthening the bilateral relations with Russia and identifying a number of companies to help us improve our investments back home, he said.VP Mphoko, who was once Zimbabwe s Ambassador to Russia, said relations between the two countries were strong, dating back to the liberation struggle. We ve been good friends with Russia since the days of the liberation struggle. Some of us started here militarily and we ve quite a number of other people who are familiar with this country due to the strong relations between the two countries. If you remember in 2008 the Russians for the first time after 16 years used their veto power to block the British from imposing wholesale sanctions against Zimbabwe. That emphasises the relationship between Zimbabwe and Russia, said VP Mphoko.In 2015, President Mugabe visited Russia for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union s defeat of Nazi Germany after being invited by Russian President Vladmir Putin in his capacity as then African Union Chair.The President took the opportunity to engage his Russian counterpart on the $3 billion platinum project in Darwendale and agreements around medicine, general engineering, agriculture and other sectors.He also told Russian investors about Zimbabwe s abundant mining, energy, tourism and transport infrastructure development potential.@pamelashumba1
