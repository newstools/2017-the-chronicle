Obriel ChirindaRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BANTU Rovers striker Obriel Chirinda has been ruled out of tomorrow s clash against Harare City after suffering a career threatening injury in Thursday s 1-4 loss to Shabanie Mine in Zvishavane. Chirinda had to be substituted in the 60th minute after the home team s goalkeeper Samuel Mafukidze stuck his boots on him.The 20-year-old who got the consolation goal for his team in Zvishavane was reportedly rushed to a hospital before the end of the match and was released to the club who took him to a specialist in Bulawayo.Rovers physiotherapist Takura Musasa said the injury doesn t look good and they will be able to establish the damage by Monday. It doesn t look good and there could be damaged ligaments. For now we can t establish the extent of the damage because the knee is swollen, said Musasa.The development means that Chirinda who has been giving opposition defenders a torrid time will be out for a long time.Rovers will now rely on 18-year-old McCarthy Dube, Newman Sianchali and Gladman Bharibhari to lead their attack.They also have skipper Bukhosi Zakhu Sibanda who can support the strikers coming from the midfield.Rovers are second from the bottom with six points from nine outings and will be hoping to get at least a point from Harare City who are on position 16 with seven points.City, just like Rovers are hard-pressed for a win so that they can move out of the murky relegation waters.City signed former Bulawayo City and How Mine gaffer Philani Beefy Ncube on Wednesday and the coach began his job with a 1-0 home defeat to Dynamos on Thursday night.&nbsp;
