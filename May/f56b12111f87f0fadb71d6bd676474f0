On May 10 we received a report of 21 stolen cattle from Thekwe Farm which had been driven to an unknown destination. The cattle rustlers are suspected to have cut off the pen fencing and drove away the herd. The herd had been branded with computerised, personalised brands which apparently led to their recovery, said Insp Ndebele. On May 16, a tip off was received from an informant to the effect that he had seen a young man driving a herd of 17 cattle into Ruby Farm in Gweru. The original brand marks had been tempered with. He said police and the owner of the cattle tracked down the beasts.The owner of the cattle, Mr Lingani Masuku of Thekwe Farm, positively identified his cattle valued at $7 400. We managed to identify the stolen cattle through their personalised brand marks and so urge farmers to brand their livestock for easy identification, Insp Ndebele said.He said police are appealing to members of the public who may have information on the whereabouts of Dube to report at the nearest police station.@winnie_masara
