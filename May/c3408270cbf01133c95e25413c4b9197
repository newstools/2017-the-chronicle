Willard KatsandeIT seems Kaizer Chiefs cannot function properly without Zimbabwe national team player Willard Katsande and Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela has just confirmed it. Komphela rued the absence of Katsande after The Glamour Boys lost 0-1 to Walter Musona s Polokwane at the Peter Mokaba Stadium last Saturday night. We missed Katsande because he gives you an added advantage with his robustness in the middle of the park, he was quoted as saying on the club s official website.Kick Off also reports that with the influential Siphiwe Tshabalala also sidelined there was a new complexion to the AmaKhosi midfield but Komphela feels that Hendrick Ekstein and Keagan Buchanan acquitted themselves well. Siphiwe Tshabalala was also out and that gave Hendrick Ekstein a chance to play and he also did well, said the coach. Buchanan played well. He didn t have match fitness, but he commanded himself well under the circumstances. We have started to check certain pieces to give us clarity on individual players and combinations. Delving into the reasons behind the loss his team suffered, Komphela was critical of the lack of killer instinct displayed. We should have killed the game in the first half, he stated. We will continue to do our best until the end of the league programme. We came here to win. We wanted to collect the three points. We looked threatening, especially in the first half, but we couldn t finish. We will go back to the training ground and do our best to win the two remaining matches. Sportszone.co.zw
