Mrs Boitatelo MnguniNqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has urged teachers to quickly adapt to the new education curriculum as failure to do so will see a generation of learners losing out in their studies. The country is in the process of implementing a new curriculum which is expected to transform the country s education sector.Since it was effected in January, some teachers have been reluctant to embrace it complaining that the curriculum was not supported by adequate learning materials.Government has since availed $9 million to support the implementation of the new curriculum, with teachers being urged to take a leading role in the utilisation of the fund.In an interview yesterday, Matabeleland North Provincial Education Director Mrs Boitatelo Mnguni said teachers must not move at a slow pace as pupils risk being left behind.Mrs Mnguni said teachers should know that the new curriculum is here to stay and dragging feet on the matter would be unhelpful. Some teachers seem to have not realised the seriousness of the programme while others have moved from their shells of complaining.They have started realising their potential and we are now happy with the progress being made. But we ve those moving at a chameleon pace, who still seek to be hand held when the material has been provided to them, she said.Mrs Mnguni said teachers should realise that failure to adapt to the new curriculum would affect the first examinable classes next year. The children will soon start writing examinations, they must move fast because if they don t do that there is a generation that might lose out. There are some pupils who are now in Form Five and if teachers lag behind, Form Six is fast approaching and you will find examinations are written using the new syllabus. Time is not waiting for anyone so they should move fast, she said.@nqotshili
