Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter HEARTS of Oak and Chipembere Queens have joined the Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) increasing the number of teams competing this season to 14. Initially, 16 teams were meant to compete in the league before Masvingo Queens, Cowdray Park Queens, Black Rhinos and Herentals were dropped out after failing to pay affiliation fees.As a result, Bulawayo will now be represented by Borrow Jets, Street Set, Inline Academy, New Orleans and Hearts of Oak in the national league.ZWSL vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane believes the addition of two teams will make the league more competitive. We now have 14 teams and I believe this is good for the league as this will make the contest for the championship more challenging. Teams have been itching for this league and we are looking forward to seeing who will come out tops at the end of the season, said Silengane.Meanwhile, the ZWSL has invited up-and-coming coaches to seek attachment at their clubs to get practical experience instead of just doing coaching courses. Coaches should come and be attached to ZWSL clubs to get experience and progress to the next level of coaching than to just attend courses without getting practical experience as required for progression to the next level. It is not proper to be an academic without experience. We therefore call upon coaches to come to women s soccer clubs for attachments, reads a statement on the league s Facebook page.ZWSL Table after week oneP W D L GF GA PtsBlue Swallows 1 1 0 0 4 0 3Tonderainyika 1 1 0 0 3 0 3Inline Academy 1 1 0 0 4 2 3New Orleans 1 1 0 0 3 1 3Conjuit 1 1 0 0 1 0 3Mwenezana 1 1 0 0 1 0 3Street Set 1 0 0 1 2 4 0Borrow Jets 1 0 0 1 1 3 0Mufakose 1 0 0 1 0 1 0Zvishavane Pirates 1 0 0 1 0 1 0Cyclone Queens 1 0 0 1 0 4 0Faith Drive 1 0 0 1 0 4 0Chipemebere Queens 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Hearts of Oak 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @khumzallen.
