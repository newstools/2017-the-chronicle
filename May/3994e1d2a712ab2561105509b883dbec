It s going to document my everyday life and adventures. From the moment I wake up to the first thing I drink in the morning, Zahara said with a giggle.She said the show which is currently being filmed came from an idea for a movie she announced last year on her Facebook fan page. I ve camera crews following me and documenting some of the things I ll be doing. I want it to be as real as possible so it s unscripted and completely real. Fans can also look forward to seeing the star s adventures on her recent tour to the UK. The UK was amazing and I can t wait to share the moments I had with my fans. I think people will be very surprised to learn about the real Zahara and not the one they see being written about in the newspapers, she added. TimesLive
