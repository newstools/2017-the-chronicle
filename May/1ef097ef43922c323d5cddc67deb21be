Amanda Chikari, Midlands Reporter A 15-YEAR-Old boy from Gweru has appeared in court for inserting fingers into his four-year-old step sister s privates. The teenager, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor but is from Southdowns suburb in Gweru, appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mr Morgan Nemadire facing one count of indecent assault. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was remanded to Monday for continuation of trial.In defence the juvenile said his stepfather fabricated the matter because there was bad blood between the two of them. He alleged his stepfather never liked him and at one time called him a devil child. Prosecuting Mr Lloyd Mavhiza told the court that in September last year, the accused was at home with his stepsister and their mother was sleeping in her bedroom. Accused went on to lure the complainant into his room and inserted his fingers into the complainant s privates once and let her go. On October 1, last year the complainant reported to her father that her privates were itching. She repeated it again resulting in him taking action. The very same day the complainant s father went with complainant to her elder sister s place where the sister examined the minor s privates and observed some fresh bruises. The elder sister went on to interrogate the juvenile who narrated the ordeal to her, said Mr Mavhiza.The court heard that the complainant was taken to the hospital where she was medically examined and a medical report was produced, leading to the juvenile s arrest. @Amanda 49
