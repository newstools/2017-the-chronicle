We have a new coach and new players, meaning the guys need time to get into the right groove. For us, it s not about the championship, but building a side and developing players that might one day move to Europe or other big clubs. Our time will come to compete for the championship, but that time is not now. However, this doesn t mean we re in the league to make up the numbers; we re here to effectively compete, said Nkomo.Former champions Chiefs extended their winning streak to three games by beating Victoria Falls Tigers 3-1 in the resort town on Saturday. Chiefs coach Thulani Sibanda praised his charges for sticking to his game plan. Before the match, I spoke about taking our opponents seriously and treating the game like a cup final and the boys did just that. We knew that if we allowed our opponents to come at us, we were going to struggle and we forced them to be on back foot from the first whistle. We wanted an early goal to unsettle them and we got it. I m happy for the boys, said Sibanda.Casmyn continued with their perfect start to the season as well, beating Chiwororo 3-2 at White City Stadium, while perennial campaigners ZPC Hwange needed a late penalty to beat Zim Leopards 1-0.Week Three ResultsSaturday: ZPC Hwange 1-0 Zim Leopards, Victoria Falls Tigers 1-3 Bulawayo Chiefs, Black Boots 0-4 ZRP Bulawayo Province, Amagagasi v Moto Moto (cancelled), Chiwororo 2-3 Casmyn, Makomo 0-1 Talen Vision, Indlovu Iyanyathela 5-0 Mosi Rovers, Bosso 90 (BYE)P W D L F A GD PTSBulawayo Chiefs 3 3 0 0 6 1 5 9Casmyn 3 2 1 0 5 2 3 7Indlovu Iyanyathela 2 2 0 0 6 0 6 6ZRP Bulawayo 3 2 0 1 7 3 4 6ZPC Hwange 3 2 0 1 4 1 3 6Talen Vision 3 1 1 1 2 2 0 4Chiwororo 3 1 0 2 5 6 -1 3Mosi Rovers 2 1 0 1 2 6 -4 3Zim Leopards 3 0 1 2 3 5 -2 1Amagagasi 2 1 1 0 0 2 -2 1Black Boots 2 0 1 1 0 4 -4 1Bosso 90 2 0 1 1 3 5 -2 1Makomo 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0Moto Moto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Victoria Falls Tigers 2 0 0 2 1 6 -5 0 @ZililoR
