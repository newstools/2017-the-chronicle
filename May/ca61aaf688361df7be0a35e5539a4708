Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIFA will this year hold a Caf B licence for former players who have played football at the highest level and who would want to pursue a career in coaching. Zifa vice president Omega Sibanda said this year the organisation will roll out various coaching courses as they seek to increase the number of coaches in the country which will also make it easier for clubs to meet the new club licensing requirements.He said this year there is going to be a Caf Pro Licence course towards the end of the year, two Caf A courses, four Caf B courses and six Caf C coaching courses.Already the first Caf B coaching course was completed in Zvishavane on Monday which saw 26 coaches taking part.A goalkeepers coaching course is also on the cards in June and will be held in Kwekwe.Sibanda said the Caf B coaching licences for former players will only be extended to those with a reputable record. We are going to hold a Caf B Licence for former players in June but we are not going to be allowing any other player for this course. We will consider players who played for the national team and those who did exceptionally well while playing in our local premiership. We realised that there are players who want to take up coaching and because they have played at that level, their entry point should be a Caf B coaching badge, said Sibanda.Turning to the issue of local coaches who hold foreign qualifications, the Zifa vice president said the coaches will have their qualifications regularised through the Zifa technical director s office.He said for foreigners their qualifications would be regularised through Caf and said the association will soon be strict with foreigners who have inferior qualifications as they will not add value to our local game .Meanwhile, Zifa have appointed Zifa Central Region board member John Marima to be the regional technical coordinator for the region.He takes over from Benedict Moyo who is now an instructor. @lavuzigara1&nbsp;
