It is an offence to wear an incomplete police uniform.Prosecuting, Mr Dlodlo said on Monday at around 615AM, the complainant, Mr Jabulani Mhlanga, a former police officer, was driving his commuter omnibus from Binga to Bulawayo when Ndlovu flagged down the car for a lift.Mr Mhlanga stopped and picked Ndlovu who was clad in a police uniform. The court heard that when Ndlovu got into the kombi, he was wearing an incomplete police uniform raising suspicion from the kombi driver.
