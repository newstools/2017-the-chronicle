On April 30 at around 7:30PM, the now deceased phoned me advising me that she was experiencing stomach pains after drinking a concoction with the intention to abort. I went off line after I ran out of airtime. On May 2 at around 3PM I was phoned by Saul Mandiki informing me that the now deceased had passed away, said Loice.Mandiki, who is employed as a domestic worker in Mvuma, said in an affidavit, he fell in love with Eunice who was five months pregnant on April 24.He said even though the woman had been impregnated by another man, he accepted her.Mandiki said on the same day that Eunice eloped, she died. On May 1 the now deceased came to my house and I welcomed her with warm hands. Upon arrival she was complaining of the cold weather and I gave her warm water to bath whilst I was making her some tea. After bathing she came and drank two cups of tea and a few minutes later she started complaining of stomach pains and she ordered me to go and call her former employer to come and help but I told her that she wasn t home since I didn t find her when I went to collect her clothes earlier, said Mandiki.He said her condition later deteriorated.Mandiki said he rushed to their neighbour to ask for help to no avail. I went back home and found the now deceased lying dead in the blankets in a pool of blood and a pre-mature baby wrapped in a piece of cloth, he said.According to a post mortem report, Eunice died of suspected abortion.@pchitumba1
