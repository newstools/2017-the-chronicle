President MugabeFelex Share, Harare Bureau President Mugabe yesterday mourned veteran politician and national hero Cde Naison Khutshwekhaya Ndlovu, saying the veteran leader never betrayed the liberation struggle despite the persecution administered to him by the Smith Regime. Cde Ndlovu succumbed to prostate cancer on Monday morning in Bulawayo. He was 86.He will be buried at the National Heroes Acre on Saturday.In his condolence message, President Mugabe said Cde Ndlovu had served Zimbabwe dependably. I learnt with a deep sense of shock and sorrow of the death yesterday (Monday) of Cde Naison Khutshwekhaya Ndlovu in Bulawayo, he said. While he has not been well for quite some time, we prayed all along for his speedy recovery. Sadly, this did not come to pass and our revered veteran nationalist and freedom fighter has been taken away from us and gone forever. His untimely death is a terrible loss to his family, his party Zanu-PF and the nation, which he served so diligently and faithfully his entire life. President Mugabe said he knew Cde Ndlovu during the early days of the liberation struggle. He belongs to that early crop of African nationalists who pioneered the resistance to white colonialism and fought for black majority rule, he said. Like many of his colleagues in the struggle for our independence, he too endured long stints in jail and detentions at the evil hands of the Smith regime. In spite of all that persecution, he never prevaricated or betrayed the liberation struggle. He was a true revolutionary cadre and remained so after independence to the very end of his life. The President added: He shall be sadly missed by all of us who had the privilege of working closely with him and many others whose lives he touched in so many different ways. On behalf of the party Zanu-PF, Government, my family and on my own behalf, I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Ndlovu family, especially his wife Sithokozile and the children on their saddest loss.
