We re investigating a burglary and theft case that occurred in a warehouse in Lupane where bond notes amounting to $8 091 and US$5 610 as well as R14 620 was stolen on May 5. Employees left at the end of business only to discover the theft the following day, said Insp Makonese.She said when employees reported for duty the following day, they found a cash vault in which the money was being kept open.The money was missing from the vault that was operated electronically. We appeal to businesses not to keep large sums of money in their business premises. We also call on business owners not to reveal their pass codes to many individuals as this can be used against them, she said.Some individuals and companies keeping large sums of money at home and at their business premises continue to lose their cash after ignoring advice from authorities to take their money to banks each day. Last month, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that companies should deposit all their daily takings into banks saying it was a crime to hoard cash. @nqotshili&nbsp;
