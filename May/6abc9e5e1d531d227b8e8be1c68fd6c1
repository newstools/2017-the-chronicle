An unidentified man from the suburb who has since also been arrested allegedly assisted Sibanda to conceal the crime.However, the man did not appear in court yesterday.In her warned and cautioned statement, Sibanda admitted that she killed her niece, but did not state the motive behind the alleged murder.Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said sometime in August last year, Sibanda visited her in-laws in Zungwana Village in Lusulu, Binga.She took Thandeka from Ms Catshepi Cinile Khumalo and promised to bring back the girl on her next return from Bulawayo.The court heard that upon arrival in Bulawayo, Sibanda physically abused her niece by assaulting her using sticks resulting in the girl sustaining injuries all over her body.
