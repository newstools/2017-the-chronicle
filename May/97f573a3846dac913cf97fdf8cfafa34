A SUPERB century by Sean Williams, followed by four wickets from Graeme Cremer, were the leading performances as Zimbabwe A completed a comfortable victory over Canada by 78 runs at Harare Sports Club yesterday. Zimbabwe A brought in the national captain Cremer and Donald Tiripano to replace Nathan Waller and Chris Mpofu.Canada were depleted as they lacked their best batsman, the injured 17-year-old Bhavindu Adhihetty, and their best bowler of the first match, Satsimranjit Dhindsa, who was strangely being rested and was to be sorely missed.It was again a bright sunny morning as Zimbabwe A won the toss this time and decided to bat first on a pitch that was in good condition, but took some turn.Solomon Mire and Chamu Chibhabha again opened the Zimbabwe A batting, to the bowling of Mark Montfort and the leg-spinner Junaid Siddiqui. Williams was the star of the show.The final match of the series takes place again at Harare Sports Club today.ScoresZimbabwe A 285-5 in 50 overs (Sean Williams 114*, Sikandar Raza 47, Chamu Chibhabha 35; Saad Bin Zafar 2/39, Mark Montfort 2/66)Canada 207 all out in 45.1 overs (Navneet Dhaliwal 39, Hamza Tariq 35, Varun Sehdev 30; Graeme Cremer 4/27, Tendai Chatara 2/43) Zimbabwe A won by 78 runs zimcricket.
