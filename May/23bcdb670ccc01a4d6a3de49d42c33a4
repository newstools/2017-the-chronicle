Mr Jason MachayaPatrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief THE Government has availed a farm to establish a new dump site for Gweru, a development that will see the old site near houses in Woodlands Park suburb being decommissioned. The Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs Cde Jason Machaya said the development was a relief to residents in Woodlands Park suburb who risked contracting diseases as they live near a dumpsite. I m glad to announce that we have identified a new site for a dumpsite for the local authority. This is great news for Gweru City Council as well as its more than 6 000 residents who have houses and shops in the area. The new dumpsite means the local authority is decommissioning the old one, said Cde Machaya.He said Government was happy with private developers in Gweru in particular and the Midlands province in general as they were assisting to achieve the country s target on housing provision.Cde Machaya said 56 000 stands have been serviced in the province since 2013.Woodlands Park Phase One and Two were developed by a private developer River Valley Property (RVP) under Vungu Rural District Council.Gweru Town Engineer Robson Manatsa said Woodlands Park was now benefiting from Gweru City Council in terms of provision of services. Woodlands Park residents are now connected to the city s water and sewer reticulation systems and the council is now collecting refuse from the suburb, he said.Mr Artwell Shoko, a resident, commended the Government and council for working together to establish a new dumpsite and extending council services to Woodlands Park suburb. @pchitumba1.
