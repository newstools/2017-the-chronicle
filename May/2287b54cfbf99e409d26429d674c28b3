Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent HAVE you ever wondered what happens when you put Martin of Ndolwane sound and King of Sungura Macheso on the same track? Well wonder no further, a band from Nkayi, Dakamela Super Sound s genre can be described as the love child of Rumba and Sungura which has resulted in the birth of a vibrant genre called Isixhovingo.Driven and inspired by diversity to reach a wide audience, Dakamela super sounds is named after the place where most of its members come from which is the late Chief Dakamela s area in Nkayi district, Matabeleland North province. The band sings in Shona and Ndebele to come up with a unique sound appeal which is yet to be recognised in different circles.Though the 10- member band made up of seven men and three ladies, has been hosting live shows for the last six years, it is yet to produce an album.The encouraging news however is that the group is working on their first album, Isixhovingo Vol.1 which will have Shona and Ndebele songs.The band leader, Khulekani Nyathi believes the track Nduna Dakamela is going to be a hit.Nyathi said it was not an easy task coming up with their own genre. I know people still have a lot of question, especially in relation to our genre. That s why from this Saturday we are going to be hosting shows around the country.People should come in their numbers to sample tracks from our coming album, he said.
