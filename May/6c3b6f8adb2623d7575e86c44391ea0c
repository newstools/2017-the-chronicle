She said civil servants unions would be meeting officials from the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing tomorrow to iron out sticky issues. Government has identified land and has come up with designs of the flats which we have discussed and agreed on, Mrs Alexander said. They have also given us information on all the sites which would have the flats throughout the country. We have since designed the registration forms for them to come up with a database. The cost structure for residential stands is still under discussion, but for the flats we have agreed on the price and it s a matter of workers securing mortgages. Added Mrs Alexander: On registration, our members are guided by the designs and price structure. Government had given us a deadline to submit the forms, but we wrote to them requesting for an extension as teachers were still on holiday. Now that they are back, we hope that the coordination will be easier. We are scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon where we expect to submit the first batch of registration forms. We are happy with the progress so far and our members are excited. Some workers are hesitating to join the scheme thinking it s connected to the bonus issue. It should be made clear that the residential stands process and bonus have been separated following the agreement that was reached between Apex Council and Government. Secretary for Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Engineer George Mlilo said he would give a detailed position after tomorrow s meeting.Government is addressing the national housing backlog among civil servants in line with the the Government s economic blueprint, Zim-Asset, which targets to provide 300 000 housing units by next year. At least 500 000 civil servants are expected to benefit in the grand scheme, with financial institutions being roped in to offer affordable lines of credit.
