Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter EIGHT teams have registered for the Bulawayo Amateur Football Association (Bafa) Under-20 League set to kick off on May 28. The teams include Thorngrove, New Lobengula Rovers, Mountain Climbers, Chiwororo, Bulawayo City, Golden White, SBC Falcons and How Mine.Introduced this year for the first time, Bafa chairman Chris Mtungwazi said the U-20 league will serve as a transition stage for juniors moving to higher leagues. We noted that most of the talent gets lost along the way as there are few juniors being promoted straight into senior teams. This league will therefore cater for such talents where they will stay competitive while awaiting promotion to senior teams, he said.Mtungwazi said the association has so far engaged with a number of sponsors for the league and they will be announced once everything has been finalised. He also called on interested parties to come and register as there is still room for other teams. We are looking forward to the start of the league and I would like to invite teams that are interested in taking part in this year s competition to come and register. We are running against time that s why the league is starting on the month end of May. Four teams in the league have already started preparations by playing friendly matches against each other, Mtungwazi said.In the friendly matches played last week, Thorngrove beat New Lobengula Stars 3-1 while Chiwororo won 4-3 against Mountain Climbers. @khumzallen
