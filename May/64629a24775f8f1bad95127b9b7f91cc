My family has been very supportive, but things are tight for them now. It is not nice feeling like a burden to the family, said Mr MabhenaHe said he had found a kidney donor and had already done all the required paper work.He said the stumbling block now was lack of funds for the kidney transplant, air tickets for him, the donor and a caretaker as well as money for their upkeep while in India.Mr Mabhena said he needed at least $25 000 to cover all the costs including their upkeep in India.He said doctors advised him that the procedure could be done in South Africa but would cost twice as much.@andile_tshumaWelwishers may contact Mr Mabhena on 0773747385
