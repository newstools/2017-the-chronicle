On 27 April Sibanda who is the school bursar was assigned to collect the tiles and he was given $508 as discount for the school. Sibanda forged a receipt where he stated that the school had been given a discount of $172 and he pocketed the remaining $336, she said.Mrs Sibanda said on May 2 the school principal, Mr Nkosilathi Ndlovu was going through the records when he realised that the receipt which Sibanda had brought had an anomaly.She said Mr Ndlovu went to Bathroom Boutique Tile Shop to inquire about the receipt and the manager said it had not been issued by his company.Mrs Sibanda said Mr Ndlovu then discovered that they had been given a $508 discount and not $172 as had been claimed by the bursar.Mrs Sibanda said the matter was reported to the police resulting in Sibanda s arrest, but the stolen money was not recovered.In mitigation, Sibanda said he stole the money as he wanted to use it intending to pay it back after receiving his salary. I was desperate for money that is why I converted the school funds for my personal use. I was to return the money after receiving my salary but unfortunately I was arrested before I was paid, he said. @DubeMatutu&nbsp;
