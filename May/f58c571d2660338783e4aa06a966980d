All is set for the event and I can say we have received a good response from the clubs, with 500 athletes set to compete. This is the first competition of its kind in the country and we are looking forward to having more of these triangular series events in future, Tagara said.He also said plans to start the competition from provincial level were in the pipeline.

Some of the athletes the province will be counting on are Nigel Tom, Willard Mutasa, Trust Chidomaya, Sukoluhle Mlala, Annie Chirisa and Faith Dube.JM Busha 54 Races is a non-profit organisation involved in social investment programmes aimed at promoting sport, education, peace and unity among other things.@khumzallen
