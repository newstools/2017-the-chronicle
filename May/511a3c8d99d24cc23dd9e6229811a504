Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ADRIAN Banana rose from the bench to score a brace for Southern Region Division One League leaders Bulawayo Chiefs in their 6-0 mauling of Black Boots on Sunday. Banana (21) is on loan from Premiership side Chicken Inn and the brace took his season s tally to three goals in four matches. He is now in line to bag the Nokel Security Top Goal Scorer of the Month accolade.Banana came on at halftime in place of Fortune Nkomozana and his coach Thulani Sibanda heaped praises on him. We ve been using Banana as our impact player and he is proving to understand that role. Two weeks ago he came in as a second half substitute and got us the only goal as we beat title rivals ZPC Hwange and this time he has scored a brace. I like his workrate and above all the collective effort made by the team when we defend and create opportunities for others, Sibanda said.Chiefs other goals came from Arthur Musiiwa, Polite Moyo and Moses Majika, while the other was an own goal.Chiefs have maintained their 100 percent run in the league with 12 points from four games and enjoy a two-point lead over second-placed Casmyn. Casmyn beat Makomo 3-0 to keep pace with Chiefs.A brace by Phillip Banda and strike by Brian Muza took the Turk Mine-based side s points tally to 10 points.Like Chiefs, Casmyn are unbeaten and will be hoping to continue with their good run under new coach Dazzy Kapenya.Southern Region Division One League Week 4 ResultsSaturday: Casmyn 3-0 Makomo, Talen Vision 2-0 Indlovu Iyanyathela, Mosi Rovers 2-3 Bosso 90, ZRP Bulawayo Province 1-0 Amagagasi, ZPC Hwange (BYE)Sunday: Bulawayo Chiefs 6-0 Black Boots, Zim Leopards 1-1 Victoria Falls TigersTableP W D L F A GD Pts Bulawayo Chiefs 4 4 0 0 12 1 11 12 Casmyn 4 3 1 0 8 2 6 10 ZRP Bulawayo 4 3 0 1 8 3 5 9 Talen Vision 4 2 1 1 4 2 2 7 Indlovu Iyanyathela 3 2 0 1 6 2 4 6 ZPC Hwange 3 2 0 1 4 1 3 6 Bosso 90 3 1 1 1 6 7 -1 4 Chiwororo 3 1 0 2 5 6 -1 3 Mosi Rovers 3 1 0 2 4 9 -6 3 Zim Leopards 4 0 2 2 4 6 -2 2 Amagagasi 3 0 1 2 0 3 -3 1 Victoria Falls Tigers 3 0 1 2 2 7 -5 1 Black Boots 3 0 1 2 0 10 -10 1 Makomo 2 0 0 2 0 4 -4 0@ZililoR
