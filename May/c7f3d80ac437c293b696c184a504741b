Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau BEITBRIDGE Rural District Council (BBRDC) has partnered the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to construct a clinic in Chabili area with the assistance of the army in Beitbridge East. The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) is providing labour to build the clinic which is set to benefit 5 000 people from Ward 3.BBRDC chief executive officer, Mr Peter Moyo, said the project, which began in 2013, was nearing completion.He said the clinic would be the seventh health centre in Beitbridge East constituency. The idea is to have at least two clinics per ward. At the moment we have six and our aim is to reduce the walking distance by villagers of 10km and above to access primary health services, he said. So far we have covered a lot of ground at Chabili with the assistance of IOM, the Zimbabwe National army which is providing labour and the Minister of State Security, Cde Kembo Mohadi who is also the Member of Parliament for the area. Mr Moyo said the IOM had mobilised funds.He said the clinic would benefit people from Chabili, Lungowe, Lukange, Lukungwe, Madaulo and Tshikwelengwe. The main structure has been completed with only a few areas left. Currently the workers are finishing up a nurses house and we are happy with the progress on the ground. As a local authority we are confident that the completion of this new health centre will go a long way in improving service delivery and the community s well-being, said Mr Moyo.He said the local authority was also open to public private partnerships in areas around infrastructure development.Late last year another clinic was opened at Mtetengwe, some 40km along the Beitbridge-Bulawayo road.Beitbridge district has an estimated population of 130 000, with over 17 health facilities including surgeries and the 140 bed referral hospital.&nbsp;
