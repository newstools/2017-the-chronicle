Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CHIWORORO defender Morgan Mungombe is on course to claim the Southern Region Division One League s Nokel Security Top Goal Scorer of the Month with four goals. Alfred Mehlomakhulu of Indlovu Iyanyathela, who is on three goals, can beat Mungombe to the prize should he score more than two goals in tomorrow s encounter with Casmyn.Zifa Southern Region administrator Augustine Ndlovu said the month s leading marksman will be announced after all the teams have played four games. The winner of the Nokel Security Top Goal Scorer of the Month will be announced after the weekend games when all teams have each played four games.The winner will get $150 and we hope to see more goals, said Ndlovu.Adrian Banana of Bulawayo Chiefs, who has scored three goals from four games, is out of the race.Mungombe s Chiwororo take on ZRP Bulawayo in a potentially explosive encounter and should he bag the accolade, he will become the first defender to win the award, which was introduced in 2015.Former Njube Sundowns and Railstars striker Sizalobuhle Dube took a swipe at First Division strikers and questioned their potency. It s shocking that a defender has scored more goals than strikers in the opening stages of the season. We are accustomed to midfielders giving strikers a good run in terms of going for the top goal scorer award. In my own view, the present crop of strikers is letting us down. In the past we used to see Premiership sides going to Division One in search of strikers, but with such poor conversion rates, I doubt any will move during the mid-season window unless they start scoring, said Dube.Bosso 90 forward Muziwakhe Dlamini, who has two goals in three matches, has a slim chance of winning the award.Dlamini needs to score at least three goals in Sunday s clash against Talen Vision which will be the main curtain raiser to the blockbuster Premiership match between Highlanders and Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium.Southern Region Division OneSoccer League FixturesTomorrow: Indlovu Iyanyathela v Casmyn (HQ One Brigade), Black Boots v Zim Leopards (Fairbridge), Amagagasi v Bulawayo Chiefs (Victoria Falls)Sunday: Chiwororo v ZRP Bulawayo Province (White City, 12PM), Mosi Rovers v Makomo (Victoria Falls), Bosso 90 v Talen Vision (Barbourfields, 12PM) Southern Region Division One League tableP W D L F A GD PtsBulawayo Chiefs 4 4 0 0 12 1 11 12Casmyn 4 3 1 0 8 2 6 10ZPC Hwange 4 3 0 1 7 1 6 9ZRP Bulawayo 4 3 0 1 8 3 5 9Talen Vision 4 2 1 1 4 2 2 7Indlovu 3 2 0 1 6 2 4 6Bosso 90 3 1 1 1 6 7 -1 4Chiwororo 3 1 0 2 5 6 -1 3Mosi Rovers 4 1 0 3 4 12 -9 3Zim Leopards 4 0 2 2 4 6 -2 2Amagagasi 3 0 1 2 0 3 -3 1Vic Falls Tigers 3 0 1 2 2 7 -5 1Black Boots 3 0 1 2 0 10 -10 1Makomo 2 0 0 2 0 4 -4 0 @ZililoR
