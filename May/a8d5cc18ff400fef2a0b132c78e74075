Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, Showbiz Correspondent COLLABORATING with the Environmental Management Agency for the second time, the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) in Bulawayo will tomorrow hold its annual School Art Competition at the gallery. The competition, being held through an exhibition titled Celebration time with environment in Mind , will feature schools from Matabeleland North and South, Midlands and Bulawayo. The students with outstanding works will be selected to represent their various provinces and schools at the national competition taking place in Harare on June 3.NGZ Bulawayo curator, Clifford Zulu, said the exhibition was based on unity as it will bring pupils of different backgrounds/cultures together to express themselves through art using what they find in their environment. The materials used by the students to come up with this exhibition are broad as they picked whatever we perceive as waste/garbage and came out with their art pieces, said Zulu.He thanked schools in the region for co-operating saying a lot of artwork had been submitted to them for the competition. The schools were forthcoming and supportive of the schools arts competition which is proving to be popular annually. The Partnership between the NGZ and the EMA brings forth a new dimension in the schools visual arts exhibition funding matrix, enabling many school children from across Zimbabwe s 10 provinces to lend their voices to the discourse of sustainable society through visual narratives while improving their artistic skills. &nbsp;
