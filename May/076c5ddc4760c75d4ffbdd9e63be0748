Walter Mswazie, Masvingo correspondent MASVINGO City Council has received $345 000 from the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) for road rehabilitation and maintenance. Chief Engineer Mr Tawanda Gozo said the local authority received the funds recently and some of the money has already been spent on emergency works.He said council has also engaged 20 casual workers to help in the rehabilitation and maintenance of roads in the city.Eng Gozo said roads that were destroyed by heavy rains will be prioritised.He, however, said progress in the maintenance of roads in Runyararo West suburb was being hampered by the breakdown of equipment.Masvingo Mayor Councillor Hubert Fidze said council resolved to procure a grader to complement the existing road equipment, most of which was obsolete.He said council urgently needs at least $25 million for road rehabilitation and maintenance given the magnitude of the damage caused by the incessant rains. @walterbmswazie3
