Maneto died on Monday in Botswana after a short illness.A family representative Luckson Black said funeral arrangements are yet to be made. His death came as a shock to us because we didn t even know that he was sick. We only received the sad news from Botswana that he is no longer with us.He leaves behind a deep void which no one else can fill because he was the breadwinner of the family. It s a really big loss to us as a family, said Black.Former teammate and close friend Ben Makadzange said Maneto s passing is not only a loss to the family, but to the football community. I couldn t believe it when I heard the news. I m still failing to come to terms with the news because he was more than a former teammate to me. I can say we had become a family because we come from the same suburb. This is a big loss not only to the family but also to the football community because he advised youngsters. He was a perfectionist who hated losing and inspired the younger generation to take football seriously and enjoy playing, said Makadzange.Maneto s football peers include the late Emmanuel Sibanda, the late Zebron Magorimbo, Gibson Homela, Ebson Sugar Muguyo, the late Musa Muzanenhamo, the late Onias Musana and the late Isaac Banda.Mourners are gathered at H9 Mzilikazi in Bulawayo.He is survived by a wife and three children.@khumzallen
