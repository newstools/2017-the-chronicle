It was a great night seeing people sing along with me and dance was the best night of my life. As an artiste we want such things to happen to us always, said Diliza.Madlela Skhobokhobo is on a purple patch in terms of his music as people never get enough of his hit song Ngamnanka. Although performing using a CD, the axe wielding artiste captured the crowd with his antics on stage and dances.The attendance was good, maybe because it coincided with the International Nurses Day celebrations that were being held at the venue.A revelation to the crowd were the Zankaleli hit makers, Ras Boom and DJ Ace Kater, who gave a polished performance on their Bulawayo debut. They seem to know how to work the stage. Bulawayo artistes gave a good account for themselves with POY, Guluva 7 and Kontrol Tribe having to make up for their boss Cal_Vin s absence as he is in Cape Town, South Africa.
