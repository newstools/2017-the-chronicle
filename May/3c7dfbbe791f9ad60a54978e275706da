Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Women s Soccer League (ZWSL) yesterday held a player registration and licensing workshop for Central and Southern Region teams using the Fifa Connect system at St Patrick s Hotel in Bulawayo. The system seeks to eliminate double player registration, curb age cheating, enable online player transfers and reduce the hassles of clubs travelling to complete player registration.Eight teams, which include Southern Region s Street Set, Borrow Jets, Inline Academy, Cowdray Park Queens and New Orleans as well as Central Region s Chipembere Queens, Masvingo Queens and Zvishavane Pirates attended the workshop facilitated by Zifa transfer matching system officer Timothy Mazhindu. Zimbabwe Women s Football (ZWF) vice-chairperson Samukeliso Silengane said the system will go a long way in developing women s football in the country. This move was taken to allow smooth player movements between clubs, among other things. Previously there were hassles with players moving from one team to another without proper procedures being followed, so through this system, we are trying to counter that, said Silengane.The workshop was the second after another one was held at the Zifa training grounds on Wednesday with eight teams from the Northern and Eastern Regions attending.Silengane said the workshop was part of preparations for the national Women s Super League, which is scheduled to kick off this weekend.The Super League will be making a return after a four-year absence due to squabbles that had engulfed women s football in the country.Women s Soccer League week one fixturesStreet Set Queens vs Masvingo Queens; Faith Drive Queens vs Cowdray Park Queens; Cyclone Queens vs Black Rhinos; Correctional Queens vs Herentals Queens; Zvishavane Pirates vs Mwenezana Queens; Conjuit Sisters vs Mufakose Queens, Borrow Street Jets vs New Orleans; In Line Academy vs Chipembere Queens. @khumzallen.
