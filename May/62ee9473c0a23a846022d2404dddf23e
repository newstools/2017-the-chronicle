Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ZIFA will hold a one-week Level One coaching clinic for Southern Region women football at Raylton Sports Club in Bulawayo from tomorrow. Zifa Southern Region technical and development committee member Mkhululi Mthunzi said the coaching course is also targeting sports journalists, juniors and Christian league coaches. We hope everyone will attend this course, especially those from the junior leagues, because we are trying to meet the Zifa requirements that no one should be on the technical bench without proper qualifications. Junior football is the cornerstone of football development in the country and it is important that coaches are equipped with knowledge and skills to nurture talent at a very tender age, said Mthunzi.According to the new Zifa standards, juniors, primary and secondary school coaches should have a minimum qualification of a local Level Two and Grassroots certificate in coaching.Among the programme facilitators will be former Mighty Warriors utility player Sithethelelwe Kwinji 15 Sibanda, who recently made history by becoming the first locally-based female coach to attain a Caf A Licence.Mthunzi challenged women to make use of such courses, which are meant to empower them. Female representation within the coaching fraternity is very low, so this is a chance for every woman involved in the game of football to develop themselves. That is why Kwinji is one of the facilitators of the course in order to inspire others, Mthinzi said.Organisers of the coaching course have discounted the course fee to $40 per individual.@khumzallen
