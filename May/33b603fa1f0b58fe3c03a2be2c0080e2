Erol AkbayRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AFTER crowd trouble brought their blockbuster Castle Lager Premiership match against Dynamos to a premature end in Bulawayo on Sunday, Highlanders turn their focus on a tough encounter with Harare City at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. Highlanders coach Erol Akbay said the disturbances that halted Sunday s tie did not affect his players mental attitude and they were geared to fight for three points today. I told my players that what happened at Barbourfields Stadium doesn t concern them and they understood. They also understand that what s important now is to play Harare City and win the game. Everyone is excited and looking forward to the game against Harare City, said Akbay.He also heaped praises on his charges for their 40-minute performance against Dynamos and believes if they carried the same attitude into today s match, they will return to Bulawayo with maximum points.At the time of the game s abandonment on Sunday, the two giants were evenly balanced 1-1 and it was the controversial equaliser by Dynamos Christian Epoupa that led to crowd trouble, as the goal appeared to be scored from an offside position. Highlanders had shot into the lead through a 23rd minute beauty by skipper Rahman Kutsanzira from outside the box.Akbay has warned his players against complacency. Harare City are a good side and the fact that they have been struggling to get wins makes them dangerous. We can t afford to underestimate Harare City, Akbay said.A win by more than a two-goal margin would catapult Highlanders from fifth place to the top of the league table with 13 points.History favours Harare City in the capital, with the Sunshine City boys winning three of their previous five PSL matches against Bosso played in Harare.They have only lost once and drawn once.Highlanders broke the winless streak against Harare City in the capital last season with a 1-0 win courtesy of Allen Gahadzikwa s strike.Harare City are fourth from the bottom of the table with six points from seven outings and will be searching for their second win of the season this afternoon. They go into today s encounter smarting from a 0-1 loss to Ngezi Platinum Stars at the weekend.Harare City have a strong squad, but luck has eluded the boys from the capital. Players expected to lead their search for a second win include goalkeeper Maxwell Nyamupanedengu, Jimmy Tigere, Protasho Kabwe, Tatenda Tumba and the striking duo of William Manondo and Pritchard Mpelele.Highlanders on the other hand will pin their hopes on goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda, defenders Peter Muduhwa and Tendai Ndlovu, midfielders Kutsanzira, Erick Mudzingwa and Gahadzikwa, as well as strikers Prince Dube and Rodreck Mutuma.Rescheduled Match Day Three FixturesToday: Harare City v Highlanders (National Sports Stadium), Chicken Inn v FC Platinum (Luveve)Tomorrow: Dynamos v Black Rhinos (National Sports Stadium), ZPC Kariba v Caps United (Nyamhunga)@ZililoR
