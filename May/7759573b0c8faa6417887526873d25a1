Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A BINGA man who stole a police uniform from his friend and used it to catch a free kombi ride to Bulawayo, has been sentenced to an effective two years in jail. Thembalenkosi Ndlovu (26) of Kariangwe Village was convicted on his own plea of guilty to impersonating a police officer and unlawful possession of camouflaged uniform by Bulawayo magistrate, Mr Tinashe Tashaya.Ndlovu will spend 26 months in jail after an additional two months from a previous conviction at the Kadoma magistrate s court under CRB1258/16, where he also impersonated a cop, was brought into effect.A scruffy civilian belt and Timberland boots which he wore with the police inspector s uniform, sold him out. It is an offence to wear an incomplete police uniform.In passing sentence, Mr Tashaya said impersonating a police officer was a serious offence which warranted a custodial sentence. You are an unrepentant criminal who has a previous conviction under CRB1258 in Kadoma. This is your second time to impersonate a police officer and clearly your conduct tarnishes the image of police, said the magistrate. Wearing a police uniform is a very serious offence which warrants a custodial sentence. You should therefore be taken out of society before you commit serious crimes in police uniform, ruled Mr Tashaya.Prosecuting, Miss Liane Nkomo said on Monday last week at around 6.15AM, the complainant, Mr Jabulani Mhlanga, a former police officer, was driving his commuter omnibus from Binga to Bulawayo when Ndlovu flagged him down the car for a lift.Mr Mhlanga stopped and picked Ndlovu who was clad in the police uniform.The court heard that when Ndlovu got into the kombi, he was wearing an incomplete police uniform raising suspicion from the kombi driver. The accused person was putting on a pair of blue police riot trousers with a civilian belt and shoes and a police shirt with badges for the rank of a police inspector, said Miss Nkomo.On arrival in Bulawayo, Mr Mhlanga drove the vehicle to Drill Hall Police Station intending to alert police. The kombi driver drove to Drill Hall Police Station to hand Ndlovu over the police, but as they reached the station he jumped out of the vehicle and tried to flee resulting in the police apprehending him, said the prosecutor. @mashnets&nbsp;
