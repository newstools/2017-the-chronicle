Lovemore Zigara in Gweru MSU s unbeaten run in the Zifa Central Soccer League went up in smoke on Saturday at the hands of visiting Ivan Hoe, who pipped them 1 0 at MSU Grounds. Dennis Banda struck the game s solitary goal in the 51st minute to secure maximum points for the goldminers.The win saw the Kwekwe-based outfit moving to sixth position on the league table with eight points from five games.MSU relinquished top spot and dropped to third spot, a point adrift of new table toppers ZPC Munyati.The students coach Themba Chingwena blamed the loss on complacency on the part of his charges. We missed most of our chances and they converted theirs. Such things happen in football and moreover the team was complacent after we had posted three consecutive wins, said Chingwena.His Ivan Hoe counterpart Julius Chakupewa, whose side has now posted two consecutive wins, said he wants to maintain the purple patch. It s a positive sign and the challenge is to maintain that run for a longer period. We have a new team after the majority of players left, but that is not an excuse for us. In any case, we want to do better than last season, said Chakupewa. Ivan Hoe finished third last season.Elsewhere, ZPC Munyati powered to the top of the table by edging Blanket Mine 1 0 to go a point above second-placed Whawha, who sit on 10 points.ZPC Munyati coach Isaac Nyabvure said their challenge was to maintain pole position.Former Premiership side Border Strikers recorded their first win of the season by beating Nichrut 1-0 at Dulivhadzimu Stadium in Beitbridge.Results: Telone 1 0 ZRP Gwanda, Gwanda United 0 0 Makusha, Border Strikers 1 0 Nichrut, ZPC Munyati 1-0 Blanket Mine, Black Eagles 1 0 Kwekwe Stars, Vumbachikwe 2 1 Silo United, Whawha 1 0 FC Platinum U19, MSU 0-1 Ivan Hoe, Tongogara 0 0 Chrome Stars@lavuzigara1
