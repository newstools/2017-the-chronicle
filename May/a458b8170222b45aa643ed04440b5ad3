Tendai ChikuniLovemore Zigara in Gweru SHABANIE Mine supporters seem to have forgiven former head coach Tendai Chikuni if scenes following their 0 0 draw against his new club Chapungu in a Castle Lager Premiership match at Maglas Stadium in Zvishavane are anything to go by. Chikuni quit Shabanie Mine at the beginning of the year after securing a Premiership slot for the asbestos miners to take over the reins at Chapungu.The Shabanie supporters embraced Chikuni as the coach made his way to the Chapungu team bus.A Shabanie Mine fan, who identified herself as Madawu, said Chikuni was a hero who deserves respect for guiding the club back to the topflight league. As Shabanie Mine supporters, we have nothing against Chikuni. In any case, he deserves our respect because for us to be in the Premiership, it s because of his hard work. The fact that he joined Chapungu is part of football which happens everywhere, said Madawu. Another fan Cleopas Hove wished Chikuni well with his new club. The least we can do for Chikuni is to thank him for the work he did here at Shabanie Mine. I really wish him well and I hope he will soon start to post positive results at Chapungu, said Hove.Some people had anticipated a hostile reception for Chikuni for ditching the asbestos miners and poaching some of the club s best players, among them Ricky Bota, the reigning Zifa Central Soccer League player of the year.However, the appearance of Chikuni from the dugout was without any incident.@lavuzigara1
