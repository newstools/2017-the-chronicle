Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested two men from Imbizo plots for cultivating dagga. Christopher Andrew Kelly (53) and Bhekimpilo Tshuma, both of Plot 5 Imbizo, were arrested on Sunday last week following a tip off from members of the public.Acting Bulawayo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Abednico Ncube said when the police raided the plot, Kelly had allegedly uprooted the plants and hidden them in a storeroom. Police arrested the two following a tip off from members of the public. But it seems accused one suspected that the police would raid his home so he uprooted the plants and hid them in a storeroom. The police officers managed to trail the route which he used to drag the nine plants of dagga into the storeroom. Along the path some of the plants leaves were falling off, said Asst Insp Ncube.He said there was a standoff between the officers and Kelly who did not want the police to search his storeroom. After a protracted struggle he finally gave in and allowed the police to search his storeroom where nine plants of dagga were found. One of the plants was two metres long, Asst Insp Ncube said.He said the police were yet to establish the dagga s street value and investigations were underway to establish whether the dagga was being cultivated for commercial purposes. We re yet to establish whether they were cultivating the weed for sale. We hope the arrest will ease unruly behaviour that could be fuelled by drugs in the city. The suspects could have been responsible for supplying it in the city, Asst Insp Ncube said.He urged residents to continue partnering the police in fighting crime in the city.@nqotshili
