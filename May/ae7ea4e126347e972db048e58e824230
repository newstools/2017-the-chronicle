Judges look for the youngest possible animal at the highest weight with 15 months to two years being a good age.In the judging of pens, like a pen of two for example, the cattle have to be almost identical to win in their various classes.The Bulawayo Agricultural Society was set up to promote agricultural shows as a teaching and learning platform for all.It showcases all forms of livestock including cattle, sheep and goats, pigs, poultry and horses, crop produce such as maize, small grains and cereals as well as fruit and vegetables for the communal farmer.Home industries incorporating needlework, knitting, crochet, cookery, icing, brewing, home-craft and artwork as well as school projects such as cookery, needlework and home craft for juniors are also included.The agricultural show is an opportunity for farmers to interact and learn from each other.Zimbabwe has a well-developed and diversified agricultural sector, producing food crops, cash crops, and livestock.The government has boosted the agricultural sector by providing electricity in some rural areas through the Rural Electrification Programme and provision of free seed, fertiliser and implements.This has gone a long way in empowering farmers.&nbsp;
