Samukeliso SilenganeSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Women Football has extended an olive branch to clubs that have not registered under the Zimbabwe Women Soccer League to come forward and register with the only recognised women football league under the leadership of Roselyn Kanonge. Kanonge s deputy Samukeliso Silengane said clubs must heed the call by Kanonge to come on board and register with the national league for the development of women football in the country.Her calls come amid disturbing reports that some disgruntled clubs are running a parallel league to that which is recognised by Zifa and all other football bodies Caf and Fifa. They must heed the call by the chairperson Kanonge that all clubs who were part of the 2014 league should come and register regardless that we were ushered into office by 12 teams. The chairperson said in her acceptance speech that we are a neutral leadership and all clubs must therefore come together and make one national league, said Silengane during an interview with ZTV Lunch time news on Thursday.She said a number of teams who were playing in the so called parallel league have now come on board and joined the legally recognised league as far as Zifa is concerned.Silengane said it was worrying that most of the clubs who were in the parallel league were actually from uniformed forces because they were misinformed by unscrupulous individuals.Meanwhile, Zifa has called for more partnerships from the corporate world to promote women football development. This comes amid baseless claims that the women s top flight league is dysfunctional despite it having started two weeks ago.Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela said the league is fully funded by Zifa and urged people to desist from denigrating efforts made by the national association to promote women football. We have noted with dismay, media reports that women football is dysfunctional. Such reports are false, baseless and without facts as the league is running smoothly. The league commenced two weeks ago and is fully funded by Zifa, Gwesela told the association s official website www.zifa.org.zw.He said Zifa s keen focus on elevating women through football can only be realised with full support from all Zimbabweans. The association, led by Phillip Chiyangwa, values the development of women s football and the eventual emancipation of women through sport, therefore, it will never abdicate from its responsibilities. Zifa urges those responsible for manufacturing and spreading such falsehoods to desist from doing so and instead, partner Zifa in developing and promoting women football, Gwesela added.Zifa s thrust to have a smooth running and competitive league is premised on creating a strong national team ahead of the 2017 Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) Women s Championship to be held in Bulawayo in September.Week Three fixtures:Today: Hearts of Oak vs New Orleans; 1000 hours (Barbourfields Stadium), Street Set vs Mufakose Queens; 1300 hours (Barbourfields Stadium), Borrow Jets vs Mwenezana Queens;1100 hours (Luveve Stadium), Conduit Academy vs Blue Swallows, 1300 hours (Madoda Stadium), Cyclone Stars vs ZRP Harare; 1000 hours (Harare High School), Masvingo Queens vs In Line Academy; 1300 hours (Mucheke Stadium), Faith Drive Queens vs Chipembere Queens; 1100 hours (Nyamahuru High)Sunday 21 May: Zvishavane Pirates vs Correctional Queens 1200 hours (Kadondo Stadium)&nbsp;
