Philani Beefy NcubeRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TSHOLOTSHO FC are today expected to name a new head coach to take over from Farai Tawachera, who threw in the towel at the weekend following yet another defeat. The Zhwane Boys suffered their fifth consecutive league defeat when they fell 1-2 to Bulawayo City at Dulivhadzimu Stadium in Beitbridge on Saturday.Tsholotsho are at the bottom of the league table with just four points from nine games.Tawachera joined Tsholotsho in August last year from the Southern Region Division One League side Chiwororo as assistant to then head coach Lizwe Sweswe.Tavaka GumboThe much travelled gaffer, who has also had stints with the now defunct CMED Gwanda, Talen Vision and Bulawayo Chiefs, among other teams, leaves Tsholotsho swimming in the murky waters of relegation.Mlamuli Phiri, the Tsholotsho FC chairman, said they were working on appointing a substantive coach before their Africa Day home game against Ngezi Platinum Stars. There are coaches who had applied for the job in January after Sweswe left for FC Platinum and those are the people we are considering. We gave Tawachera the job because he was with us as an assistant to Sweswe, but now that he has thrown in the towel we have to act fast and appoint a coach. Check with me tomorrow I think we would have made a decision, Phiri said.Among the coaches Tsholotsho are reportedly considering include former Shu-Shine and Hwange gaffer Tavaka Gumbo, Philani Beefy Ncube and ex-Old Nic Mine s Twyman Ncube.Twyman NcubePhiri believes the new coach will drive them out of the relegation zone. It is unfortunate that Tawachera has decided to leave us after bringing in experienced strikers Thabani Moyo and Nqobile Mpala in efforts to address the team s attack. He has laid the foundation for us and the new guy will benefit from the guys that Tawachera brought in. It s not that the team was playing badly, they were doing good, but were just unlucky. If we win three games we will move up the table, said Phiri.ResultsSaturday: Chapungu 1-0 Harare City, Tsholotsho 1-2 Bulawayo City, Bantu Rovers 1-2 Highlanders, FC Platinum 2-0 Yadah FCSunday: Ngezi Platinum Stars 2-1 ZPC Kariba, Chicken Inn v Caps United (Postponed), Dynamos 1-1 Shabanie Mine, Triangle United 2-0 How Mine, Black Rhinos 3-0 Hwange@ZililoR
