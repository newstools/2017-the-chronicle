Sharon Chiware, Midlands Reporter THE city of Gweru has gone for 24 hours without water following a power outage at Gwenhoro dam and a burst water pipe from the major line in Lundi Park suburb. Residents have resorted to fetching water from unprotected sources while those with boreholes have been selling the precious commodity for $4 per 20litre bucket.Taps in Gweru ran dry on Tuesday morning and by Wednesday at 5PM, they were still dry.City Engineer Robson Manatsa confirmed the development adding that the two problems were being attended to. We are experiencing power challenges here in Gweru and this has resulted in Gweru going for days without water. We also have a pipe burst in the Golf Course (Lundi Park) on a major line which supplies Mkoba South, Lundi Park, South downs, South view and Ivene. Our plumbers are working on it now and we expect normal supplies to have resumed before end of day today, he said.Eng Manatsa said residents should not worry about water challenges now or in the future as the two water supply dams, Amapungogwe and Gwenhoro are full.He said disruptions will however, be faced here and there due to aging infrastructure. Due to the incessant rains which were experienced early this year, all the dams are full and now the challenge is not of having empty dams but the bursting of pipes and power outages , he said.Eng Manatsa said council has managed to re-commission the water reservoirs in Kopje area to minimise water shortages in the city. To solve this crisis in Gweru we have looked at other issues which cause water shortages and we have managed to re-commission the water reservoirs in the Kopje suburb which has a total capacity of 64 000 cubic meters which had been lying dormant for more than a decade.Meanwhile, Gweru Mayor, Councillor Charles Chikozho said companies and residents who are defaulting in clearing their water bills will have their properties attached. There are several companies which have their properties being taken away from them after they had failed to settle their water bills. Loads of valuable properties such as cars were taken from various local companies and were put on the auction yard, he said.- @sharonchiware1
