Tendai ChikuniSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AIR Force of Zimbabwe commanders have backed the Chapungu technical bench led by Tendai Chikuni, who they believe will eventually turn around the fortunes of the struggling side presently anchoring the league table after six rounds of matches. The Gweru-based airmen leadership also believes the recent appointment of Rodwell Dhlakama as technical director will help stabilise the sinking plane.In fact, the club leadership s fear is that Chikuni might be worried about what they think of him to the extent of feeling insecure. It s a process; we will come right soon and as the leadership we are not pressing any panic buttons at all. Some of the players are still teething and will soon adjust to the rigours of the Premiership. We have a young coach whom we believe in, said Chapungu chief executive officer Air Commodore Innocent Chiganze. We recently brought in Dhlakama and they have only been together for two games, which we believe is still too early to judge. Chikuni s job is safe and he has all our support. In what will be sweet music to Chikuni, whose only experience as a coach in the Premiership was as assistant to Rahman Gumbo at FC Platinum, Chiganze said the entire leadership fully supported his programme of action. The young man (Chikuni) might be panicking, getting worried about what we are thinking of him, but to be honest we are impressed with his plan and we believe it will fall into place sooner rather than later and besides in a football club set up, a lot of factors determine the outcome, so it might not be fair to wholly lay issues on the coach. For us, we know the players are happy and are one of the few in the league with a pension that secures their future, said Chiganze.Chapungu s next assignment is a home encounter against table toppers Highlanders at Ascot Stadium and the Bulawayo giants match comes following the Midlands side s 0-4 mauling by Caps United on Saturday.@skhumoyo2000
