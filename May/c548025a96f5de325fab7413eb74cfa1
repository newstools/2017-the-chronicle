Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Castle Lager Premier Soccer League s leading scorer Bukhosi Zakhu Sibanda will lead Bantu Rovers search for their second win of the season when they play host to Yadah FC at Luveve Stadium tomorrow. Rovers, who have the most porous defence that has conceded 15 goals in six games, are second from the bottom with three points from a 1-0 Week Three win over Triangle United.Sibanda has been impressive for Rovers, with assistant coach Joseph Sibindi praising the Young Warriors striker s work rate.Sibindi believes his charges are on track to register a positive result, adding that they are ready for Yadah FC. Bukhosi is a hard worker and what you see him doing on match day is exactly what he does during our training sessions. We value his input and hopefully he will give us the same energy and lead the guys when we play Yadah FC on Saturday, said Sibindi.Sibindi watched helplessly as his charges took turns to miss glorious scoring opportunities in their 0-1 loss to How Mine on Monday, but said they had worked on those shortcomings. We ve been doing drills to address that and the young boys need to be encouraged so that they gain confidence. In about two to three weeks time, you will start to see a different Bantu Rovers side as the boys would have gained experience, Sibindi said.How they respond against a Yadah FC side that is also smarting from a 1-0 loss to Dynamos will be key for Rovers campaign.Rovers are fretting over the availability of experienced defender Dumisani Fazo Ndlovu, who was involved in a nasty collision with How Mine s Toto Banda on Monday. Ndlovu reportedly did light training on Wednesday and complained of pain around his ribs.The Bulawayo side cannot afford to lose Ndlovu, who has been guiding the youthful backline in the absence of the injured Tapiwa Khumbuyani.Players that should be key in Rovers quest for maximum points against Yadah FC include goalkeeper Stephen Chimusoro, left-back Jillen Nsingo, midfielders Lucky Ndlela and Munyaradzi Chitambwe as well as the striking trio of Sibanda, Obrey Chirinda and Newman Sianchali.Yadah FC players to watch are former national team goalkeeper Tafadzwa Dube, left-back Brian Briya Chikwenya, formerly with Bulawayo City and Bulawayo Chiefs, as well as ex-How Mine utility player Moses Gutu.They also have strikers Wellington Kamudyariwa and Moses Demera, skipper Brian Mapfumo and ex-FC Platinum winger Tatenda Dzumbunu, who can cause Rovers anxious moments. @ZililoR.&nbsp;
