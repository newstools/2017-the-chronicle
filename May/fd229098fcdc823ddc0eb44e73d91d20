Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has approved the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the development of a 100 megawatt solar power plant in Gwanda. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development Engineer Partson Mbiriri said this in Bulawayo Tuesday, adding that the project was set to begin in the third quarter. EMA has just approved Gwanda solar power plant feasibility study and it is our hope that construction of the project will begin before the end of the year, particularly in the third quarter where we intend to start the civil works, he said.In October 2015, the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) entered into a deal with Intratrek to construct the solar plant at a total cost of $202 million.Intratrek is owned by businessman Mr Wicknell Chivayo and his Chinese partners, Chint Electric.Last year, ZPC executives visited the Export-Import Bank of China to finalise funding discussion for the solar project.The power company had commissioned Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute (SEPD), a subsidiary of energy giant Power China, to do the feasibility study.Eng Mbiriri said so far the Government has prioritised the development of two more solar power plants in Munyati and Insukamini. Despite some negative publicity the Gwanda solar project has of late received from the media, that project is at a more advanced stage than the Munyati and Insukamini projects, which we have also prioritised. So far, the portion where the perimeter fence will be erected at the project site has been cleared, he said.The power plant is expected to take 18 months to complete once the project takes off.According to the SEPD feasibility study, Zimbabwe has total radiation of sunshine of between 2 500 and 4 000 hours per year. It has since been established that the Gwanda solar power project is feasible at a tariff rate of 18 cents per kilowatt hour.Over the years, Zimbabwe has been facing a power deficit due to lack of investment in new electricity generation projects.Against this background, the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has since 2010 licensed about 25 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) with the projects being at different stages of implementation.@okazunga
