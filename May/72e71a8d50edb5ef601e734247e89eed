Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE director of international development for the International Tchoukball Federation (FITB) Julio Calegari will be in Bulawayo from May 20-21 to conduct a two-day workshop as part of promoting the sport in the country. Tchoukball is a game that combines the features of volleyball and squash and is played by two teams of seven players each. The game has two frames on both ends of the court.These frames are one square metre of which the net is a 78 square centimetres. The frames are inclined at 55 degrees. The court has a line which runs three metres and forms a semi-circle. This area is called the forbidden or D zone. Players have to throw the ball at each other until the shooter hits the frame to score.Zimbabwe Tchoukball Federation representative Sheunesu Masuka said they are aiming at introducing the sport at grassroots level. Julio is working with us to promote the sport in Zimbabwe and we desire to see it grow from grassroots right up to national level and us participating at international level. The sport is in its infancy with a small community being exposed to it. Our goal is to equip like-minded people, passionate about development to be coaches, who will introduce it in various communities, said Masuka.Calegari, originally from Brazil, has been to more than 25 countries around the world introducing and assisting in the promotion of the sport and also helping in the organisation of international events and friendly matches. @khumzallen&nbsp;
