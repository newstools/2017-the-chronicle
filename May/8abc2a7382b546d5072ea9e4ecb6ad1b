We have tried our best and we are ready for the competition. In terms of preparations everything went according to plan and what is now left is for the girls to put into practice what we have been doing on the training field. We are only going to know our group opponents after tomorrow s draw but we are not scared of any team. I hope we will be placed in a group with the strongest teams so that we see our potential, Mudiwa said.He said he believes the school has become a basketball hub considering that the school came first in the men s competition. I think we are on the right track as a school. The boys team also did well in the same competition and they will be representing the province in the national competition. My wish is to see the girls doing the same thing or at least having quite a number of them being selected to the provincial team, he said. @khumzallen&nbsp;
