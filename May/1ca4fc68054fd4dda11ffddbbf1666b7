Lloyd MutasaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGH riding army side Black Rhinos will be hoping to continue with their fairytale return to the elite league when they visit the giant National Sports Stadium for a date with Dynamos this afternoon. Chauya Chipembere have conceded just two goals in seven matches, while Dynamos have conceded four and scored as many in five matches, and find themselves just above the drop zone, nine points behind leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars.Black Rhinos lie third on the table with 14 points, but according to their manager Mark Ncube, they have all the respect for their more illustrious opponents and will not want to take them lightly, neither are they putting themselves under unnecessary pressure.Statistical history favours the Glamour Boys as they are yet to concede a goal against the soldiers in 10 years. We are more than motivated to be hosted by one of the big brothers of domestic football. The boys are eager to go and have been waiting for this opportunity to judge themselves in the Premiership. We have told them not to put themselves under any pressure, but to play their normal game, said Ncube.Black Rhinos coach Stanford Stix MtizwaDeMbare are yet to find their feet this season and have a number of new players that are still to understand the culture of the club, but on their day, they can be deadly, although the soldiers have so far proved their defensive prowess to all and sundry.In another league match set for this afternoon, Caps United make the long trip to Nyamhunga Stadium for a date with ZPC Kariba where they hope to quickly erase their 0-2 loss to Egyptian kings Zamalek in the Caf Champions League.@skhumoyo2000
