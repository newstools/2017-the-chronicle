When we got to the scene we found the vehicle lying on its side and we took about 45 minutes to cut the doors before removing the two bodies from the wreckage. The third passenger had been ferried to Gweru Provincial Hospital after being rescued by some travellers. Unfortunately he died on admission, he said.Efforts to get a comment from Midlands provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende were fruitless as she was not in office.Her mobile phone was not reachable.The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructural Development has previously said 85 percent of accidents in the country are due to human error. MPs listed 12 other causes of accidents that include bad state of roads, speeding, drunken driving, fatigue, use of cellphones when driving and going through red robots.The use of second hand tyres, stationary and defective vehicles, stray animals on the roads, inadequate road signage and markings as well as lack of traffic enforcement were also cited. @pchitumba1
