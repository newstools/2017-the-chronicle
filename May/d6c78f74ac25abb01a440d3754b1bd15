Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ONE of South Africa s leading metro radio stations, Kaya FM, broadcast from Victoria Falls over the weekend as part of its listeners tour programme. A group of about 100 people comprising the Johannesburg based station s top presenters and listeners jetted into the country on Thursday via Livingstone in Zambia.They were stationed at Azambezi River Lodge and visited the Victoria Falls Rainforest, went for a boat cruise, helicopter Flight of Angels, Bungee jumping, bridge and gorge swing as well as a walk with lions and elephant ride.At Azambezi, the station s presenters who included DJs Kuli Roberts, Mosibodi Whitehead, Thomas Msengana, Bridget Masinga, T-boseMokwele and Mapasek aMokwele took turns to wow their South African listeners away from home at Amulonga Restaurant where they played a variety of songs amid wild dance and merry-making all night long.Guests booked at the hotel also joined in as the DJs brought down the house on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.Yesterday morning was departure day via Livingstone in Zambia. As Kaya delves deeper into the fascinating continent of Africa, we present a tour that is filled with exciting activities and luxury excursions. This is a unique opportunity for Afropolitan travellers who long to see nature at its best and experience one of the most spectacular seven world wonders in Africa, said the radio station in a statement.The station has been running competitions where lucky listeners are taken on a tour of majestic resorts around the continent and this time the organisers chose the Mighty Victoria Falls, a development that shone a beacon of hope to the tourism industry.Listeners meet their expenses at discounted rates negotiated on their behalf by the station through some agencies.Some of the countries that have been visited include Tanzania and Kenya.One of the travelling listeners, Dibesho Serage, lauded the trip saying it exposes Africans to the continent while also boosting tourism in host countries. Kaya is a vibrant Afropolitan station rated as the best in current affairs especially for a person who is pro-African and modern. We came here after they advertised and we took the opportunity. We have had a chance to view the best landscape of Africa from Zambia where we landed to this place. People here are warm and this exposes us as Africans to our own continent hence we appreciate being African much more than what we are told by the Western media. What we have realised is that as Africans we have our own stories to tell in our own way, said Serage.Another listener Izzy Machaba added: Am happy to be in Zimbabwe and am already planning to be back with my family. @ncubeleon
