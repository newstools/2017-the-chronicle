Tendai ChikuniLovemore Zigara, Sports Correspondent ALL eyes will be on Chapungu gaffer Tendai Chikuni when he returns to Zvishavane s Maglas Stadium where his team takes on Shabanie Mine in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter tomorrow. Chikuni guided Shabanie Mine into the topflight after winning last season s Central Region Division One Soccer League title.He had already started implementing his programme of action in the Premiership for the Chinda Boys when the airmen lured him to Gweru.There is a mixed sense of nostalgia and appreciation among the Shabanie Mine supporters with some viewing the coach as hero who took them to the Promised Land while others may view Chikuni s actions of leaving their side for the airmen as betrayal.Their convictions are cemented by the fact that Chikuni took some of their best players in Ricky Bota who was voted the best player in the Central Region, Lloyd Gwerina, Emmanuel Chitauro and goalkeeper Joseph Fernando.However, Chikuni is unfazed. I knew this day would come but if you look at it, this is any other game that we are going to play. It is not going to be an easy match and we will approach it with caution. This game is more psychological from the aspect of the players because as coaches we have done our part. I know some supporters are not happy about our departure but everyone has got a life to live, Chikuni said.Apart from the quartet, which Chikuni brought to Chapungu, the airmen are home to a number of former Shabanie Mine players who include Allan Tavarwisa, Roy Mazingi, William Ngonya, Blessed Mbavarira, Marvelous Dikinya as well as Xolani Ncube.Chikuni would also be praying that his side collect its first set of maximum points since the season began with the best result the club has posted being the three draws against Triangle, Yadah and Highlanders.On the other hand Shabanie Mine will also be hoping to bounce back to winning ways after suffering a 0-1 loss to log leaders Ngezi Platinum last weekend.For Shabanie Mine technical manager Taku Shariwa, it is also a game in which he is going to face his mentor Rodwell Dhlakama who was roped into Chapungu structures with the same role.Shariwa also faces a Chapungu side which also features his former prot g Patrick Khumbula whom he groomed during his days at Zifa Eastern Division One side Hippo Valley. I know there has been so much noise surrounding this game but we are not reading much into what the people are saying. Our aim as the technical team is to ensure that the club survives relegation and that we can only do if we win our games especially playing at home, said Shariwa.The Chinda Boys will be hoping to start to utilise home advantage where they have failed to bang the goals with their only strike at Maglas coming in their 1-0 win against Tsholotsho. @lavuzigara1
