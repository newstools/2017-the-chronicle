For the first ever arts awards in the city the response was more than satisfactory, proving that the awards were long overdue and that Bulawayo was indeed the city of creative arts and culture. The 2017 call for nominations had nearly 400 responses (nominations/entries) from both the artists and the public in general, said Baya.He said out of the nearly 400 entries, music had the most nominations. No m i n a t i o n s /entries were handed in, emailed or submitted via Facebook. Most interesting was the variety variety in terms of genre and age. As expected music had the most n o m i n a t i on s /entries taking nearly half the entries, followed by special awards category, fashion, schools awards, theatre and dance, said Baya.He added: There were very few responses in spoken word, film, literary and visual arts, other categories like the Socialite of the Year perhaps a serious indicator of the state of the sector, and in particular these disciplines.
