Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AMAGAGASI goalkeeper Wellington Muuya produced a man-of-the-match performance when the Victoria Falls side lost 0-1 to Southern Region Division One League leaders Bulawayo Chiefs, who extended their winning streak to five games on Saturday. Chiefs top the league table with 15 points from five games.Chiefs got the winning goal in the first half courtesy of a brilliant strike by striker Fortune Nkomazana who placed the ball beyond the reach of a diving Muuya.The table-toppers broke Amagagasi s defence many times, but found Muuya in terrific form as he denied Perfect Tatenda Chikwende, Nkomazana and Joshua Wilson goals from point blank range.Muuya s heroic saves even won admiration from Chiefs coach Thulani Sibanda. I m happy that we managed to pick three valuable points against a side that gave us a good run for our money. However, I must say had it not been for the Amagagasi goalkeeper (Muuya), we could have won by a bigger margin. I m happy that my players put up a strong fight and restricted Amagagasi far from the box, said Sibanda.Amagagasi rarely troubled their opponents even though they had some good build-ups in midfield.Sheppard Mwale, Darlington Tshabalala and Mavuto Ngwenya gave good accounts of themselves for Amagagasi.The defeat to Chiefs left Amagagasi at the bottom of the table with just a point from four games.Despite anchoring the league table, Amagagasi coach Zibonele Ncube was happy with the way his charges performed. Having lost 16 players during the off-season, I think we re slowly improving with every game and I m sure it s only a matter of time before we get things right. We will continue fighting and if we carry the same attitude we showed against Chiefs, I m sure we will do well in our next game. We just need one win to boost players confidence and everything will be right, Ncube said.Meanwhile, Casmyn s unbeaten run came to a halt as they suffered a 1-2 loss to Indlovu Iyanyathela.Collins Tshuma and Crispen Ncube were on target for Indlovu Iyanyathela, with Casmyn getting their consolation goal from Emmanuel Ndlovu.
