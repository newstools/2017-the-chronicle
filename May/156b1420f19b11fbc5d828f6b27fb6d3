There will be no need to carry food as it will be sold at the venue.The eat out, a brain child of Skyz Metro FM s DJ Possenti Sikhosana, will see people being entertained by DJ Mellow T. Prayersoul will also use the celebrations to launch his album at the event that starts at midday.Possenti said the event was being held to unite people through music and food. Instead of people doing the same routine at home with their families, they can come through for this event where an assortment of food will be sold with good music being played. This will also be an opportunity for people to network and for the young ones to make new friends, said Possenti.
