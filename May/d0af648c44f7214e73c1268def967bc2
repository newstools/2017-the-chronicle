Dr Nkosana MoyoKiyapili Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter FORMER Minister of Industry and International Trade Dr Nkosana Moyo has said he is seriously considering running as an independent presidential candidate in next year s elections. Dr Moyo who was appointed minister in June 2000 and resigned barely a year later, said he was approached by both Zapu and ZimPF to lead the parties, but turned down the offers saying that would not benefit Zimbabweans.Speaking at a Food For Thought Zimbabwe Debate series on Wednesday night at the NUST American Space in Bulawayo, Dr Moyo said he will make the final decision in the coming few weeks. I m confirming that I m seriously considering running as an independent presidential candidate next year. When I become a president or if you vote for me I want the country to be ruled for the benefit of all citizens. I m thinking about it and I m taking my time and will tell the whole nation in the next coming few weeks whether yes or no, said Dr Moyo.He said both Zapu and ZimPF had approached him to lead them, but he prefers to be an independent candidate.Dr Moyo said ZimPF approached him after some of its senior leaders fell out with former Vice President Dr Joice Mujuru who went on to form her own party, the National People s Party. ZimPF approached me after they had a bust up with Joice Mujuru asking me to consider taking over the leadership of their party and I said no, said Dr Moyo.He said his own view and conclusion is that Africa needs to try the idea of citizens being persuaded to vote for leaders who do not belong to politcial parties.He said as far as he was concerned, the formula is not working for citizens.-@Kiyaz_Cool
