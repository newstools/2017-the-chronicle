Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter PREPARATIONS for the World Bowling Singles Championships to be held in Australia in August are underway with Zimbabwe champion Elliah Mbulawa saying he is ready for the event. Mbulawa booked his place to this year s event after shrugging off stiff competition from 30 other competitors in the national championships held in Kwekwe last year, making him the first black Zimbabwean to represent the country in the competition. I have been training very hard for this event since last year and right now I m just waiting for the day. I have been competing in local events and judging from my performances, I think I m on the right track to face international competitors. Last month in the national championships, Bulawayo province scooped two gold medals in the Fours and Threes categories. I also believe those competitions have been preparing me very well as I have managed to identify some weaknesses that I should deal with before the big competition in August, said Mbulawa.He appealed to the corporate world to assist in sponsoring him to compete in Australia. My coaches have been working tirelessly in looking for sponsorships and from what I know, they have managed to secure one, but we are still appealing to the corporate world to come and assist. I m now prepared to lift the country s flag high in this international competition and it will portray a bad image for us if I fail to go due to lack of sponsorship. We are therefore asking for well-wishers to assist as we prepare for the competition, Mbulawa said.@khumzallen
