Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS in partnership with their partners Nyaradzo Funeral Services will this afternoon launch a new programme called the Bosso Score Pack which is meant to bring in revenue to the cash strapped Bulawayo giants. The event will take place at the club house from 2PM. We will be launching a programme that we have started with Nyaradzo which is part of our broader fan development and a corporate venture if you like which has a financial end to the club on the other end and hopefully also promotes the services of our partners on the other, this a co-operation with Nyaradzo, who are our partners and it is called The Bosso Score Pack, said Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Bahlangane Dube during a press conference on Thursday.He said the launch of the brand and product will be channelled through sales representatives from the club who will be offering the various products that the club has got in conjunction with Nyaradzo Funeral Services. This is an amazing milestone to the club because what it is saying is that the club is starting to widen and deepen its sponsorship relations with sponsors, said Dube.He said they were expecting about 350 guests but with the excitement of the blockbuster league encounter against Dynamos at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow, more people are expected to be in attendance.The two giants enjoy cordial relations with the biggest funeral services provider in the country that has seen it provide each side with a luxury bus.According to Nyaradzo, the Score Pack plan provides funeral cover for the principal member as well as an unlimited number of dependants. It is entirely up to the policy holder to choose the number of dependents they want covered under this plan. Its uniqueness is in the flexibility on the number of people that can be covered from a single person to as many people as one would want. In all instances, members children under the age of 23 are covered free of charge. With the Score Pack Plan, not only will you SCORE for you and your family but for your favourite local PSL soccer team as well. For each premium payment you make, your nominated soccer club will get paid a certain percentage at no additional cost to you, reads a brief about the plan from the company s official website.&nbsp;
