Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SECOND half goals by Adrian Banana and Arthur Musiiwa powered Southern Region Division One League leaders Bulawayo Chiefs to their sixth consecutive victory of the season as they beat Chiwororo 2-0 at Hartsfield Grounds yesterday. Chiefs victory took them to 18 points, five ahead of second-placed ZRP Bulawayo who were held to a 1-1 draw by visiting Makomo at Fairbridge on Saturday.Thulani Sibanda, Chiefs coach, heaped praises on his charges for their spirited show and believes if they maintain consistency, they can runaway with the championship. We should have won by a bigger margin, but we wasted a number of glorious opportunities. However, I m happy that we managed to score two goals against a side that was determined to get at least a point, but they found my players hungry for maximum points. I think we re in the right direction in as far as the championship is concerned. What we want to do is maintain consistency and treat each game like a final. We can t afford to lose concentration and have to keep fighting, said Sibanda.Chiefs are away to Makomo in Hwange in their next encounter.
