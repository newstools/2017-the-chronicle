Ishmael MorabeIshmael Morabe, the Roba Le Teka hitmaker is rumoured to be down and out. The musician who was part of the 999 music label was at the weekend seen bothering guests in Pata Pata at Maboneng asking them for taxi money. He was later seen on the streets of Maboneng.Sources close to the singer say Ishmael is having a tough time, and his musical career is fading. He shouldn t have left Ghetto Ruff, he should ve just let Lance groom him to work behind the scenes, the source said. But now he s pestering people for transport money and food, and you can see he looks very frail. He s been in the music scene for more than 20 years, but has nothing to show for it. Another source said: He pretended that he was special, but we could see that this man was really troubled. It s true; when days are dark, friends are few. He s now rolling solo, it s so sad. Said a third source: Ishmael must just look for a nine-to-five job and make things easy for himself because with his situation, he won t cut it. His music has gone down the drain. It ll be a miracle if he bounces back with a banger. He should just do jazz music to get a source of income. Last month, Sunday Sun reported that King Of Kwaito Arthur Mafokate had called it quits in the music industry as he shut down his 999 music label and gave artistes their clearances.Ishmael could not be reached for comment and failed to respond to SMSes.
