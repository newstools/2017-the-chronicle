Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter ENGLAND-based Zimbabwean-born boxing standout Joe Maphosa won his first professional bout 40-36 over Gary Reeve at the Leeds First Arena on Saturday night. Having stopped a few amateurs in his previous fights, the 22-year-old attributed his smooth transition to the flyweight and super-flyweight pro-divisions to hard work and dedication. It was a great fight, I really enjoyed it and it s always a learning curve for me. The fans must look for more and I can t wait to do it again. My opponent was tough because he is more experienced than me, but I listened to my guard and kept myself disciplined, said Maphosa.He said focus is now on making a name for himself in the pro-boxing world. I want to let my talent speak and let people know my name. Right now we are going back to the drawing board with the team and hopefully I will continue from where I left off, he said.Under the tutelage of Imran Naeem, Maphosa is the latest fighter to sign a promotional deal with Hall of Fame Promoter, Frank Warren.The Beitbridge-born counter puncher first laced a pair of boxing gloves at the age of 13 before joining former coach Tony Whitby at the Middlesborough ABC.Maphosa won around 60 of his estimated 75 amateur bouts, highlighted by a Golden Belt tournament win in Romania.
