I was in my vehicle with my two friends and we had agreed to move to the parking next to us where there was shade, said Julian. I checked my mirror before reversing and it was clear, there was nothing behind my vehicle. I proceeded reversing the car but my friends started screaming saying there was someone sitting behind the car. I panicked and applied the foot brake but my foot slipped off the brake onto the accelerator and the vehicle knocked the deceased. Prosecuting, Ms Grace Zhou said on February 6 at around 1PM, Mhlanga and his two friends were sitting at a parking bay in the college premises.
