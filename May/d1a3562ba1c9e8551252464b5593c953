Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter A LOCAL Christian organisation has embarked on a programme to help locals get identity documents. Adonai Project, a Christian community development organisation offers consultancy services, capacity building and skills development for the disadvantaged.Mr Mhlonipheni Sakala-Ncube, the organisation s Executive Director, said the project aims to improve the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans living in urban and peri-urban areas. Last week, the organisation was at Pumula Housing office conducting free consultation services to people who do not have or may have lost identity documents and about 400 residents attended the meeting.The area s MP Cde Godfrey Malaba said many people in his area were not originally from Zimbabwe and therefore needed assistance to acquire identity documents. There are a lot of aliens in my constituency and they really need such assistance. Most people who have come here are from Robert Sinyoka Village. They were resettled there after their illegal settlements were destroyed in Killarney. Some are from Malawi, Zambia and our other neighbouring countries, he said. You will find that three generations of the same family would have never obtained a birth certificate or a national ID We appreciate the initiative by Adonai project, it is a starting point. Adonai will assist them, write recommendation letters and refer them to the relevant offices. Sometimes from lack of knowledge, people fear approaching offices, it s good that Adonai has come to the people. Widows were among the people who came to seek assistance on inheritance issues.@andile_tshuma
