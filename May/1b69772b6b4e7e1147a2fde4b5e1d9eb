Cde Omar cruised to victory when he polled 18 700 votes against Mr Welcome Masuku of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) s 482 and Mr Turner Mhango of Free Zimbabwe Congress (FZC) s 386 votes in a by-election held early this month.He said apart from coming up with policies in parliament, national assembly members should always be on the ground with their constituents assisting in the development of their areas.He said he has managed to rehabilitate a number of boreholes, bridges and roads in the constituency using resources mobilised from well-wishers. I am aware there is a CDF meant to develop constituencies but I will not wait for it in order to develop my constituency, said Cde Omar.He said his constituents appreciate his policy on development as he does not look up to government to steer developmental activities in his area but takes a leading role. Together with people of Mwenezi East we have managed to rehabilitate 28 boreholes, repaired three bridges destroyed by Cyclone Dineo-induced floods.We have repaired a bridge that connects Rutenga with Hebron, rehabilitated Chikoko-Masangula and Bongo road for Chingwizi people and we are working on attending to a number of link roads, Cde Omar said.He urged other national assembly members to promote unity among the people so as to achieve their developmental objectives.Cde Omar said he uses his machinery for road rehabilitation and sometimes uses his workforce on a number of developmental projects in Mwenezi. He said people should learn to develop their areas to reduce the burden on Government which has a number of responsibilities. @walterbmswazie3
