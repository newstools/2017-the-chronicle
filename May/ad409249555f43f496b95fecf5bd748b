Men are very jealous and learning that their partners are cheating on them becomes very difficult to take. Some even become depressed. We have had cases where men cry during counselling sessions especially when it s infidelity related, he said.Mr Ndebele said men become aggressive as they consider the material support they would have given to their wives and in some instances payment of lobola.He said men should come out of their shells especially on issues relating to infidelity. Men should use legal channels, like counselling, or even reporting to the police and seeking protection orders where necessary to try and solve their problems instead of resorting to violence, said Mr Ndebele.@nqotshili
