Trevor DongoShowbiz Reporter BULAWAYO fans of Urban Grooves crooner Trevor Dongo will have to wait a little longer as his show pencilled for Club Connect tomorrow has been postponed. The Ndashamisika hit-maker s show, according to organisers, had to be postponed at the last hour to allow college and university students to focus and study for their exams which are ongoing.Club Connect resident DJ Prince said: The bulk of Trevor s fans are students at universities and colleges and when we invited them, they highlighted that they d love to attend his show, but it was being held at a bad time as they re writing exams. After consideration, we decided to postpone the show to a later date so as to give them an opportunity to attend the event when they re no more under pressure. He said they were yet to come up with a date when the show will be held as they also have to consult with Dongo who has a busy itinerary. We now have a lot of time to prepare for the show and we want it to be a big event. We want to give people an experience of Trevor they haven t seen before, said the DJ.A ladies cocktail party that will be spearheaded by popular host, Letty has since been put as a replacement of Trevor s show.&nbsp;
