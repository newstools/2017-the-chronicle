Hwange FC playersTobias Mandoreba in Hwange PREMIER Motor Spares (Pvt) Ltd has come up with a sponsorship package for Hwange FC whereby the team s Player of the Month will get $150 and a shield. Goalkeeper Taimon Mvula (23) became the first recipient of the award after being voted Player of the Month for April. He was presented with the money and shield before Sunday s match against Triangle at the Colliery Stadium.Mvula said the award is a sign that his hard work and determination are paying off. This is a positive development in my career and being chosen the most outstanding player shows that my hard work is paying off. My dream is to play for the national team one day and this will open bigger opportunities for me. What drives me to excel is the right attitude and I aim to maintain that going forward, said Mvula.The Victoria Falls-born shot stopper began his career as a junior in the resort town with the likes of Gift Mbweti, Nhlanhla Ndlovu and Sipho Ndlovu, who are all playing for PSL sides.Mvula was Hwange s reserve goalie from 2012-2014 before temporarily reverting to then Hwange Under-20 side in 2015 and returning to the senior team in June last year.Kenny Sambo, Premier Motor Spares director, said the package is driven by his desire to see the coal miners faring better in the topflight league. First of all, football is in my blood and I would like to see the young boys do well with some motivation. With time I will find other ways of widening the sponsorship scope as we all have to play a part in ensuring that Chipangano returns to the fame of yesteryears, said Sambo, who is also a Hwange executive committee member in charge of marketing.His company has in the past sponsored the Zifa Mat North Division Two League.The entire Hwange technical bench and the players will be involved in selecting the player of the month.@tobymandox
