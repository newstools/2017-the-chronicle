Dr Nyasha MasukaWhinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) has deployed rangers in Binga s Mlibizi area to help contain an anthrax outbreak that has so far claimed the lives of one person, 17 hippos and fish. ZimParks spokesperson Mr Simukai Nyasha said they had received a report that another hippo died over the weekend to add to the 16 previously reported deaths.He said they had partnered with the Forestry Commission and Campfire in deploying rangers who are monitoring areas affected by anthrax, a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals. Our rangers are guarding and patrolling the area, we are glad villagers are no longer accessing the meat of the affected animals and fish. The monitoring was suggested as a way of preventing villagers from eating meat from carcasses of the affected animals in order to curb the spread of human anthrax, said Mr Nyasha. Last week we discovered dead fish in Mlibizi River at the same area where hippos died due to anthrax. Apparently 27 dead fish were picked up and samples were collected and sent to the Department of Veterinary Services for analysis. Matabeleland North Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka said the anthrax outbreak was under control. As long as villagers are warned and monitored not to eat more of the affected hippo meat and the dying fish, we are sure the outbreak will be under control. During the past week, we didn t receive any reports of deaths of those affected by human anthrax and we hope to keep it that way. We are continuing to educate the community about not eating meat from animals that die on their own. We are also disinfecting areas where hippo meat was disposed or buried, he said.The Ministry of Health and Child Care, Binga CPU, Binga RDC, the Environment Management Authority and ZimParks as well as traditional leaders, have partnered to control the outbreak.@winnie_masara
