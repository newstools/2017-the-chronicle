Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BANTU Rovers captain Bukhosi Zakhu Sibanda has been rewarded for his fine form by being voted the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League s Player of the Month for April. Ngezi Platinum Stars Tonderai Ndiraya clinched the Coach of the Month award.Sibanda, the league s leading scorer with seven goals, said the accolade came at the right time when his side faces Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow.The former national Under-20 captain, who has been converted from a striker to a midfielder, said he is enjoying his role and looking forward to banging in more goals. I m very pleased that the selectors voted me as the best player for April. This is just awesome. I want to give glory to God, thank my teammates, the Bantu Rovers technical team and management for affording me an opportunity to play for this wonderful club. I wouldn t have won this award without my teammates and I m really happy, said Sibanda. This award came at the right time when we play Highlanders and obviously as a player I would want to show that winning it wasn t a fluke, and hopefully we are going to do well on Saturday, he said.The 20-year-old midfielder downplayed ambitions of bagging the end of season s Golden Boot award.With his seven goals, Sibanda is four goals shy of the 11 that Caps United s veteran striker Leonard Tsipa scored to win last season s Top Goal Scorer award. To be honest I m not even thinking about winning the Golden Boot. There are a number of matches to be played and what I want is to help the team get positive results in all the matches we play. I want to improve with every game and if scoring opportunities avail themselves, I will strive to utilise them. However, I m not under pressure at all with regards to the Top Goal Scorer s award, said Sibanda. @ZililoR.
