This is what we desperately wanted because last season we lost many points during derbies. We wanted the points and I m happy that we re joint leaders. We had a slow start to the season, but I m happy with our progress, said Kaindu.The miners enjoyed superior ball possession in the first half, but rarely troubled goalkeeper Chipezeze.Chicken Inn looked dangerous on the break and in the 27th minute How Mine goalkeeper Donovan Bernard pulled an impressive save to deny Nicholas Muchadeyi a goal.Ten minutes later, Chicken Inn striker Thomas Kadyaridzire s header off an Obidiah Tarumbwa cross hit the upright.Chicken Inn returned fired up after the break, but found the How Mine defence resolute.Chicken Inn s efforts to draw level were dealt a body blow in the 59th minute when Lunga was sent off for fouling Muganyi.With the numbers level, it was Chicken Inn who created better scoring chances, which they, however, fluffed with Ishmael Lawe missing glorious opportunities in the 63rd and 84th minutes.The miss of the day fell to How Mine striker Nqobile Ndlovu, who hit an air shot with the goal yawning after being set through by Kuda Musharu following a quick counterattack in the 64th minute.Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo said: A draw would have been a fair result, but I m disappointed with my goalkeeper who made a stupid blunder that cost us the game.
