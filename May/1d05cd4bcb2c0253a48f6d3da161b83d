Minister Walter MzembiSEYCHELLES has withdrawn its candidate Alain St Ange from elections to choose the next secretary general of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). The elections, in which Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Walter Mzembi is participating, are on in Madrid, Spain, tomorrow.Seychelles, an African Union (AU) member, had been criticised for nominating St Ange for the post after the AU had already endorsed Dr Mzembi as Africa s sole candidate.Although the UNWTO was yet to comment on the latest development, a statement by the Seychelles government said the Island nation would now support the AU endorsed candidate. President Danny Faure chaired an Extra-Ordinary Cabinet meeting at which the Cabinet considered a formal request from the African Union Commission for Seychelles to withdraw the candidature of Mr Alain St Ange for the election to the post of Secretary General of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, the statement said. In light of our standing responsibilities and commitments within the context of the African Union, the Seychelles government has decided to withdraw the candidature of Mr St Ange for the position of Secretary General. However, St Ange was widely quoted blaming the AU for exerting undue pressure on his government, resulting in his withdrawal. Africa is today losing because of the decisions taken by the African Union with a list of measures that will be imposed on Seychelles, which people are saying can be considered as blackmail, knowing fully well that Zimbabwe cannot take it (win the election), he said.St Ange is the second candidate to withdraw from the race after Vahan Martirosyan of Armenia withdrew his candidature in April.Nominees from Zimbabwe, Colombia, Republic of Korea, Georgia and Brazil have to win two-thirds of votes cast by delegates from member countries present at an executive assembly on May 12.The successful candidate will take over from Jordanian, Dr Taleb Rifai who completes his second four-year term at the end of this year. The UNWTO, a specialised arm of the United Nations, has 157 member countries, six territories and over 500 affiliate members. &#8211; New Ziana.
