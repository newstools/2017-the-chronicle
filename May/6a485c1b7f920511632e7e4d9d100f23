THE Old Mutual Zimbabwe Under-18 coaching staff have come up with a 70-member provisional rugby squad for the annual South African Youth Week after completion of a two-day trial stint in the capital. ZRU intends to send a 46-member squad that will be split into two teams; the Old Mutual Zimbabwe Under-18 for the Craven Week and an Academy side to make its debut at the Coca-Cola Academy Week. Both tournaments will run parallel at St Stithians College in Johannesburg from July 17-22.Zimbabwe Under-18 team manager, Shaun De Souza, told Sportszone.co.zw that they picked the best players the nation has at the moment and expects a serious contest for places counting down to the tour. The selection process; all went well and we identified all the players. We selected 70 players for the Under-18 and Academy but 46 players will be travelling. Why we went with a big (provisional) squad is that if we are to have injuries it will be easy to replace and it keeps everyone working hard. Whoever is fit and whoever will be exceptional will make the final squad, he said.The Zimbabwe Under-18 squad will be under the tutelage of Scot Gray who will be assisted by Cleopas Makotose with De Souza coming in as the team manager.The Academy side will be coached by Basil Dingiswayo to be assisted by Costa Dinha while Simba Dangah will be the manager.Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Under-13 squad for the Coca Cola Week set July 10-14 at Grey College in Bloemfontein was announced.
