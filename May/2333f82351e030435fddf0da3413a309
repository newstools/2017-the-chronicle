Bukhosi Zakhu SibandaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THREE Bulawayo boys have emerged as early pacesetters in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League goal scorers chart, with Bantu Rovers Bukhosi Sibanda leading the pack with four goals after six rounds of matches. Bulawayo City s Mkhululi Moyo and Highlanders Prince Dube are on three goals each with Caps United s Abbas Amidu, according to the chart released by the Premier Soccer League yesterday.The conversion rate though is a bit low, at 0.6 goals per game for Sibanda, but for someone who is not an out-and-out striker and playing for a side struggling in the league, Sibanda has done well.If the trio maintain their scoring consistency though, more goals could be scored by the end of the season compared to just 11 that earned veteran striker Leonard Tsipa $6 000 last season as the league s top marksman.According to the chart, 16 players have found the target twice, while 46 have a goal each.No player has hit a hat-trick so far, while Chicken Inn s Ishmael Lawe was the first player to grab a brace in the season s opener when the Game Cocks pummelled Bantu Rovers 5-0 at Luveve Stadium.Bantu Rovers are home to Yadah tomorrow afternoon and Sibanda might be relishing his chances of increasing his tally, while Dube s Highlanders are on the road to Chapungu United. Bulawayo City are also on the road to ZPC Kariba. @skhumoyo2000.
