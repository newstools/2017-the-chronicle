Lovemore Zigara Sports Correspondent Chapungu 2-0 Tsholotsho FCCHAPUNGU recorded their second win of the season when they beat Tsholotsho FC 2-0 in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter played at Ascot Stadium yesterday. Goals in either half by Tinei Chitora and Maxwell Mavuto was all the airmen needed to collect maximum points.The win saw the airmen taking their points tally to 11 points, easing their relegation worries after spending the better part of the season on the basement.Chapungu took control of the match in the opening stages but fluffed a number of chances.The visitors soon crawled back into the match and could have found the opener in the 25th minute when Nkosana Sibanda broke loose after catching the Chapungu defence at sea before playing a square pass to Thabani Sibanda who had acres of space in the box.Sibanda was however, a shade too slow to tap in the cross.The home side soon found their rhythm and found the opener five minutes later when Allen Tavarwisa beat his marker, released the ball to man-of-the-match Ian Nyoni who sent in a cross that Chitora connected but his effort was punched back into play by the Tsholotsho goalkeeper Chang Mariyoni.The rebound fell into the path of Maxwell Mavuto and the midfielder hit the woodwork before Chitora reacted quickly to head in the ball, torching celebrations from a sizeable crowd which was mainly rooting for the hosts.Chapungu could have doubled the lead in the 37th minute after Ngonidzashe Murisa released Nyoni on the right flank but his effort missed the target.The second half started with Chapungu asking Iziqholo ZeZhwane questions and could have extended their lead when Tavarwisa beat his marker before sending a perfect cross which Chitora missed and the visitors cleared their lines. Waru Waru soon found the insurance goal in the 63rd minute when Mavuto hit a shot which rattled the woodwork before nestling into the nets after being fed by Nyoni.The home team could have won by a wider margin had it not been for their strikers who took turns to miss. I am happy to collect maximum points especially after our midweek encounter against ZPC Kariba. Fatigue was creeping in and that is why we changed the team today but I am happy that the boys now understand my philosophy and our plans are taking shape, said Tendai Chikuni, Chapungu coach.Farai Sibanda, the visitors goalkeepers coach blamed the defeat on defensive blunders. We lost the match because of defensive errors and we need to work on that going forward, said Sibanda. @lavuzigara1
