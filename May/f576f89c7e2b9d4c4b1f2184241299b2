Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Dynamos striker Jacob Muzokomba is enjoying a new lease of life at Zifa Central Soccer League side ZPC Munyati and has been one of the reasons the powermen are having a fine run. Muzokomba s solitary strike against Midlands State University was enough to ensure ZPC Munyati collected maximum points, handing the students their first home defeat.The striker, who was deemed excess baggage by DeMbare gaffer Lloyd Mutasa, has so far found the back of the net six times in nine in the First Division.He said he relishes another dance in the topflight league and would be weighing his options when the mid-season transfer window opens. I am happy that I am enjoying my game at ZPC Munyati and I want to give credit to my coach Isaac Nyabvure, who gave me an opportunity. However, I still have what it takes to play in the Premiership and I will be listening to offers when the transfer window opens, said the Gweru-born striker.Muzokomba could, however, not divulge Premiership clubs interested in his services.Nyabvure praised his lads for showing character after their win in the top-of-the-table clash against MSU. I am happy that we have managed to collect maximum points against MSU, who to me are serious championship contenders. To win away against such a quality side shows that my boys have character, said Nyabvure.He could not be drawn into commenting on his club s title aspirations, saying the league is a marathon and we will take each games as it comes .Elsewhere, Tongogara s impeccable record in the league went up in smoke after going down 0 1 to Vumbachikwe in Gwanda.ResultsBlack Eagles 0-1 Tongogara, Telone 3-0 Gwanda United, MSU 0-1 ZPC Munyati, Chrome Stars 1-0 Blanket Mine, Ivan Hoe 2-0 Makusha, Whawha 1 1 Border Strikers, Black Eagles 2-0 ZRP Gwanda, Vumbachikwe 1-0 Tongogara, FC Platinum U19 5-1 Kwekwe Stars.@lavuzigara1
