Rahman GumboSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Chicken Inn 0 &#8211; 1 FC Platinum DESPITE a cracking start to the season in which they hammered Bantu Rovers 5-0, Chicken Inn continue to sing the blues in Bulawayo as they fell to their fourth defeat at home against an equally troubled FC Platinum at White City Stadium yesterday.Agrippa Murimba struck the all important goal in the 72nd following a defence splitting pass from Talent Chawapihwa, who reacted quicker to a lapse in concentration from the home side s back line of big Guide Goddard and Moses Jackson.The goal came after a barrage of futile attacks by Chicken Inn.It was the Gamecocks, who asked the early questions through the returning Clemence Matawu, whose second minute grounder went just wide.Innocent Mucheneka was next to try his luck in the 18th minute but his speculative shot went wide. Ten minutes before halftime, Elvis Moyo was forced to push a dangerous low cross out for a corner as Chicken Inn pressed for the opener.The visitors first real chance came in the 49th minute when Rodwell Chinyengetere forced goalie Elvis Chipezeze to dive full length to punch the ball out for a corner.Chicken Inn again immediately took charge of proceedings and could have gone a goal up in the 53rd minute had Tafadzwa Kutinyu not hurried his attempt at goal after being set up by Obidiah Tarumbwa inside the box. Instead Kutinyu chose to go for glory hurriedly instead of chesting the ball down and firing home.Two minutes later, Tarumbwa blew a chance himself when he seemed to suffer from indecision after gaining possession in the final third of the visitors half. With Matawu to his left and Kudakwashe Gurure to his right in a three on two situation, Tarumbwa chose to take a crack at goal only to sky his effort.Tarumbwa was substituted a few minutes later for Thomas Kadyaridze, although the substitution seemed to be a bit emotional and out of frustration by experienced coach Rahman Gumbo.The home side literally camped in the visitors half towards the end of the match but the equaliser eluded them until referee Thabani Bamala blew to for fulltime.Stand in FC Platinum coach Lizwe Sweswe described the match as evenly balanced and hailed his charges for utilising the chance they got. It was a tough, evenly balanced match and we are therefore happy with the win. We did not want our boss to come back under pressure, said Sweswe.Chicken Inn goalkeepers coach Julius Ndlovu bemoaned the missed chances. We feel we dominated but failed to utilise the chances that came our way, said Ndlovu.It was Chicken Inn s third 0-1 loss on the trot at home after having lost another home match 1-2 to Bulawayo City.TeamsChicken Inn: Elvis Chipezeze, Pass more Bernard, Teenage Hadebe, Moses Jackson, Guide Goddard, Thabani Goredema, Physiwell Madhazi 80th min) Kudakwashe Gurure, (Ishmael Lawe 63rd min) Innocent Mucheneka, Tafadzwa Kutinyu, Obidiah Tarumbwa (Thomas Kadyaridzike 59th min) Unused subs: Brian Juru, Pride Zendera, Nicholas Muchadeyi, Chris SamakweriFC Platinum: Petros Mhari, Elvis Moyo, William Stima, Ian Nekati, Gerald Takwara, Simon Shoko, Rodwell Chinyengetere (Winston Mhango 77th min) Agrippa Murimba, Gift Mbweti, Talent Chawapihwa(Hillary Bakacheza 91nd min) Unused subs: Kevin Moyo, Gift Bello, Nqobizitha Masuku, Charles Sibanda, Francis TizayoOfficialsReferee: Tabani Bamala First assistant: Virimai Muroiwa Second assistant: Emmanuel Mugwagwa Fourth official: Cuthbert Zigwadi Match Commissioner: Sabelo Sibindi-Maphosa@skhumoyo2000
