Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CABINET has approved the Community and Recreation Club system as a way of introducing structured sport at grassroots level. Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane said under the system, football alone will have more than 8 000 clubs across the country. The Community and Recreation Club system is a way of intervening at the community level across the country by introducing structured sport at community level. The club is the most basic cell unit of sport development and without a club we cannot function as sport and recreation and this process is already going on, said Hlongwane.He said 21 sport codes, including the so-called minority sports, will be introduced in rural communities and previously disadvantaged areas.The move is aimed at ensuring that the sport codes are integrated into mainstream sport and recreation countrywide.This follows the adoption of the National Sport and Recreation Policy in 2016 which provides for the establishment of ward, district, provincial and national structures to mobilise resources for funding of sport and recreation programmes at various levels.This has seen the Sport and Recreation Commission spearheading the establishment of provincial and district Sport and Recreation Development boards, whose mandate will be to oversee development of sport in districts and provinces, so that people own the processes and activities of sport. @lavuzigara1.
