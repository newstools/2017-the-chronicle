Tendai NdoroJohannesburg Orlando Pirates striker Tendai Ndoro expressed his disappointment to surrendering the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot to the inform Cape Town City forward Lebohang Manyama. The Zimbabwean international started the 2016/17 PSL season like a house on fire and was considered as the perfect candidate to clinch the prestigious accolade.However, his lack of regular game time since the arrival of a new coach Kjell Jonevret in February dented his scoring touch. Ndoro did not pile or pin the blame onto the Swedish born tactician as he hinted that lack of consistency from his side led to him losing the award.Ndoro scored 12 goals in total while Manyama walked away with 13 league goals respectively. This is football and anything can happen but I m very disappointed in myself for not being consistent, Ndoro lamented. First round of the season I scored all the goals and second round how many did I score? Only one and it s not good. It was still the same football and the same Tendai Ndoro playing. Anyway congratulations to Lebo (Manyama), he really deserves it. He was very consistent throughout the season. Sport24.
