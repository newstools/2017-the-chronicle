Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter THE Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) has introduced a fine for poor service delivery in the telecommunications sector as part of measures to ensure consumers get value for their money. The regulatory body has since embarked on a countrywide campaign to educate consumers about their rights so that they can hold service providers to account. The introduction of fines for telecommunications firms, which are offering poor service to consumers emerged at a consumer education campaign and the regulator will soon pounce on those firms that are giving sub-standard service, said a senior Potraz official.Earlier this year, mobile subscribers complained about data bundles and claimed to have been fleeced by mobile operators as data bundles disappear upon recharge before use.In a snap survey by Business Chronicle mobile subscribers expressed optimism that the fines would go a long way towards instilling discipline in the sector and protecting customers. We have lost a lot to these companies that have been short-changing us. The issue of data and airtime just disappearing is affecting us. The fines would make sure that the services offered are efficient and match the amount we subscribers pay, said Ayanda Khumo. @Kiyaz_Cool.
