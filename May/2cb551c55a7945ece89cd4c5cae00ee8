Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter IN an effort to help develop football in rural areas, a Victoria Falls-based football administrator Morgan Gazza Dube has adopted the Mvuthu Football Association (MVUFA) Social Soccer League in a $1 200 sponsorship deal to run for two years. The MVUFA league features 16 teams that all hail from Chief Mvuthu s area.The sponsorship was unveiled at Maransu Stadium, BH 10 Business Centre in Kachechete Ward on Saturday where four clubs that finished in the top four last season battled it out in the rebranded league.Last season s champions Red Whispers, runners up Dragon FC, Black Leopards and Saturday s winners Wounded Buffalo took part in the weekend launch.Eight netball teams also took part in the launch that drew around 300 spectators from across the ward.Dube, who is also the Highlanders FC Victoria Falls Chapter chairman, said he was concerned by the lack of sporting facilities in Hwange West Constituency hence his gesture. There is inadequate equipment and infrastructure both in the urban and rural areas of Hwange West Constituency and it s my wish that we develop these, Dube said after Saturday s launch.He said there would be a review of the deal with the possibility of extending the sponsorship and spreading it to other areas. The $1 200 only covers prize money, while clubs take care of other expenses, such as travel.@ncubeleon
