Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE state of livestock and pastures has greatly improved in Matabeleland South province this year following heavy rains that pounded most parts of the country in the last few months, an official said. Mat South provincial livestock production and development officer, Mrs Simangaliphi Ngwabi, said the province had enough pastures to cater for the 500 000 cattle throughout the year. Our livestock is in good shape and we have enough pastures in our grazing lands. However, you will note that as the grass dries, it also loses nutritional value, but that is minimal, since we have been having rains around the province, said Mrs Ngwabi. Last year we had a few deaths of livestock related to drought. This time around we are optimistic and confident that we will have a good farming season. She said although things were looking good on the ground, the livestock department would continue monitoring the situation.Close to 500 cattle reportedly died as a result of drought in Matabeleland South between October 2015 and January last year according to reports.A further 588 240 were said to be at risk of dying of hunger by the end of 2016.The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) recently reported that at least 770 hectares of pastures were under threat after being invaded by a poisonous shrub &#8211; lantana camara.Lantana camara is a toxic much-branched, upright, arching or scrambling shrub that usually grows to between two and four metres tall and forms dense thickets that affect agriculture land and pastures.It can occasionally grow like a vine (as a scandent shrub) due to its patterns of short branches and if there is support by other vegetation, in which case it can reach up to 15m in height.Umzingwane, Matobo, Insiza, Bulilima and Mangwe were reported to be the worst affected districts. In a recent interview, EMA Board spokesperson, Mr Felix Moyo said besides lantama camara, they had also managed to clear 1500 hectares, of alien invader specie, opuntia fulgida (jumping chollla).He said they had cleared 50 percent of the shrub, which had covered close to 3 000 hectares in the livestock dominant province. Mr Moyo added that researchers from local universities were still assessing the veracity of their findings on the effects of the plant on livestock.The shrub is a new invasive cactus species that is invading the semi-arid districts of Matabeleland, where it is understood to have been introduced most likely as an ornamental plant by landscape garden enthusiasts.
