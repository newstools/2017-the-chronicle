Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) will hold the last leg of the JM Busha Open Track and Field Triangular Series at the National Sports Stadium on May 25. The first two legs were staged in Harare and Bulawayo in February and March respectively, with athletes competing in 15 different categories, which include javelin, shot-put, discus, high jump, triple jump, long jump, 100m, 200m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 4 400m and 4 100m relays. The best 16 athletes in each event qualified for the finals where they will be vying for the top three prizes in each event. Our preparations have been going on well and I just want to urge all athletes to come and participate in this esteemed event. Athletes are encouraged to register on time and avoid the last minute rush. Those from outside Harare can collect registration forms at our provincial offices, said Naaz president Tendai Tagara.After the Africa Day event, next on the calendar is the Elite JM Busha 54 Marathons Race in July where athletes from across the continent are expected to attend.The JM Busha 54 Races is a non-profit organisation involved in social investment programmes aimed at promoting sport, education, peace and unity, among other things.@khumzallen
