MANCHESTER CITY are locked in a record 110million race for Monaco sensation Kylian Mbappe.City and Real Madrid are the ONLY clubs who have lodged an official interest in the striker, 18. And the French outfit s asking price will eclipse the 89m Manchester United paid Juventus for Paul Pogba last summer.United and Paris Saint-Germain are eyeing the situation too.The two big-spending clubs have kicked off the race for the most sought-after teenager in the game which will hot up in the run-up to the end of the season.Mbappe netted in both matches against City as Monaco dumped Pep Guardiola s men out of the Champions League in the last 16.The France striker s dream is to join Madrid.And while City may be reluctant to spend world record fee on an 18-year-old it might be their only chance to snatch him from under the noses of Real.Jose Mourinho s United have been sounded out but so far they have yet to declare their hand.The man expected to do the deal is Mourinho s super-agent Jorge Mendes who also took Anthony Martial from Monaco to United.Chelsea and Arsenal are also interested but unlikely to bid that high while big-spending PSG are also keen.Monaco would rather sell up and keep the youngster for another season on loan, but are unlikely to get their wish given the amount involved.
