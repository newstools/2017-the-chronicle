Trust ChidomayaAllen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Coca-Cola Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) Four-Minute Mile winner Trust Chidomaya believes last year s disappointment spurred him to clinch Saturday s race. Chidomaya failed to make the final in 2016 after falling in the semis, but his time of four minutes 17.52 seconds secured him victory against a strong field.The ZRP Fairbridge athlete finished ahead of Willard Mutasa of Bulawayo Jumbos, who ran the mile in four minutes 18.56 seconds. Blessing Chidziva was third in four minutes 19.38 seconds.Chidomaya said he went into this year s Four-Minute Mile with a point to prove. I can tell you that last year I was much stronger than this year, but I was disappointed by some few individuals, which is why I was not able to defend my title. However, I came back like a wounded buffalo this time. I had a point to prove to the nation and I went there to show that I m still the champion, said Chidomaya. I won because I trained very hard between last year and now. I was very disappointed when I did not get to the final last year, so I forced myself to work extra hard and I would like to thank everyone who supported me and encouraged me not to give up. I m looking forward to defending my title in the next competition@khumzallen
