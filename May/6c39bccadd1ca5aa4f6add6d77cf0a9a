Everyone wants to beat Chiefs and if we re to win the championship we ve to fight for every point, said Sibanda.Chiefs, who are quick on breaks, should be on the lookout for former Monomotapa defender turned striker Morgan Mungombe who is the league and Chiwororo s leading scorer with four goals.Tatenda Perfect Chikwende, Chiefs playmaker who has been the force driving the leaders attack, defensive midfielder Gracious Muleya, strikers Nkomazana, Joshua Wilson and Adrian Banana are players that Chiwororo will have to contain if they are to get at least a points.Chiwororo go into the weekend game smarting from a 1-2 loss to ZRP Bulawayo Province.The police force side, which looks to challenge Chiefs for the title, are at home to Makomo at Fairbridge this afternoon.Another interesting First Division tie is today s encounter between Casmyn and Bosso90 where former teammates Dazzy Kapenya and Melusi Sibanda face off as coaches.Kapenya, who concluded his deal with Casmyn on Wednesday, will be in charge of his first game as the third placed gold miners seek to bounce back to winning ways following last weekend s 1-2 away loss to Indlovu Iyanyathela.Sibanda on the other hand will be hoping to build from the 0-0 draw against Talen Vision and spoil Kapenya s first match in charge of a Division One outfit.At White City Stadium newboys Zim Leopards face bruised Amagagasi, in an encounter where both outfits are seeking their first sets of points.Zim Leopards are on position eight with three points from five games while Amagagasi anchor the table with just a point from four outings.FixturesToday: ZRP Bulawayo Province v Makomo (Fairbridge), Casmyn v Bosso 90 (Turk Mine), Talen Vision v ZPC Hwange (Luveve), Mosi Rovers v Victoria Falls Tigers (Victoria Falls), Zim Leopards v Amagagasi (White City)Southern Region Division One Soccer League tableTeam P W D L F A GD PTSBulawayo Chiefs 5 5 0 0 13 1 12 15ZRP Bulawayo 5 4 0 1 10 4 6 12Casmyn 5 3 1 1 9 4 5 10ZPC Hwange 4 3 0 1 7 1 6 9Indlovu Iyanyathela 4 3 0 1 8 3 5 9Talen Vision 5 2 2 1 4 2 2 8Bosso 90 4 1 2 1 6 7 -1 5Zim Leopards 5 0 3 2 7 9 -2 3Chiwororo 4 1 0 3 6 8 -2 3Makomo 3 1 0 2 2 5 -3 3Mosi Rovers 5 1 0 4 5 14 -9 3Black Boots 4 0 2 2 3 13 -10 2Victoria Falls Tigers 3 0 1 2 2 7 -5 1Amagagasi 4 0 1 3 0 4 -4 1 @ZililoR
