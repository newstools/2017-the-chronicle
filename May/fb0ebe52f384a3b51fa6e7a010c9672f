Mr Edward SiwelaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AN overwhelming 21 applications were received for the post of Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) director-general that was left vacant following the retirement of Charles Nhemachena in May year. Veteran administrator Joseph Muchechetere has been acting director-general and is also believed to be one of the 21 applicants that submitted their CVs.SRC board chairperson Edward Siwela said interviews are expected to be concluded by mid-May, although the final appointment rests with the Minister of Sport and Recreation in terms of the SRC Act. We received 21 applications by the deadline date of April 24 and we are now in the process of shortlisting candidates. The appointment of the DG though is subject to approval by the minister. I must say the response was really healthy, said Siwela.He could not be drawn into when the new director-general will assume duty since the Minister has the final say, but I hope it won t be long .The new director-general shall be responsible for, among other duties, providing overall leadership to the day-to-day operations of the commission, develop the commission s strategic and business plans, obtaining board approval and leading strategy execution in order to achieve the commission s strategic goals.The successful candidate will formulate organisational policies as well as budgetary needs and recommend them to the board for approval.The successful candidate is also expected to manage the operations, undertakings and property of the SRC and give effect to the decisions of the board. The person will manage stakeholder relations and represent the Commission at various forums as well as preparing agreed periodic activity and performance reports for the attention of the board, reads the job description.The successful candidate must have at least five years experience at senior management level, while experience in sports administration at senior level or executive committee or board level of a national sports association would be an added advantage.According to the Chapter 24 (2) of the SRC Act, no person shall be appointed as director-general and no person shall hold office as girector-general if he or she is not ordinarily resident in Zimbabwe.Indications though are that the SRC wants someone with business development experience more than sports management, as indicated in the vacancy notice, which says the person must have a first degree or equivalent in business administration or other relevant area, while a sports administration degree was listed as a secondary qualification.@skhumoyo2000
