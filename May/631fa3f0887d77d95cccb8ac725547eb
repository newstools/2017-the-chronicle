Richard Muponde, Gwanda Correspondent THE trial of the headmaster of Sabiwa Primary School, Marvellous Moyo, who is facing car theft charges opened yesterday in Gwanda. He is accused of stealing a motor vehicle from a person he had sold it to, before reselling it to a third party.Moyo pleaded not guilty before Gwanda regional magistrate, Mr Mark Dzira.The complainant, Mr Celani Moyo testified that Moyo sold him a car in 2015 and subsequently stole it. I left my car at home on a Friday and when I arrived the following Monday I found it not there. I then bumped into one Excellent driving the vehicle and he told me that he bought it from Moyo and I proceeded to make a police report because he had also sold me the same car, he said.Prosecutor, Ms Teererai Mahohoma said in August 2015, Moyo sold a Mazda 626 to the complainant for $1 400.He was paid $1 000 and delivered the car to the new owner after agreeing that the balance would be paid upon handing the vehicle s registration book to the complainant.Moyo allegedly promised to bring the registration book within two weeks but did not fulfil the promise.After a month, the vehicle went missing from the complainant s house and Moyo allegedly admitted that he had taken it for some checks and would bring it back, only to sell it to another person.The trial is set to continue on Monday when the second and last State witness is expected to testify.Moyo is out of custody on his own cognisance. @richardmuponde
