Lovemore Zigara in Gweru A mouth-watering clash is in the offing at the Midlands State University this afternoon when third placed ZPC Munyati travel to Gweru to take on second placed MSU in a Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) encounter. MSU had been the log leaders after reclaiming top spot from the power generators over the weekend but they were eclipsed by army side Tongogara who edged Black Eagles 1 0 on Africa Day to go three points clear on the standings.The army side now have 20 points from the eight games they have played so far and look set to continue their impressive run when they travel to Gwanda for a date with Vumbachikwe who have been operating in fits and starts.However, the attention this weekend will be on the clash between ZPC Munyati and the students.The two sides coaches are cautious going into today s match but they were both confident that they will walk away with maximum points. It s going to be a tough match judging by the way MSU has been playing lately. We need to be at our best and tactically disciplined if we are to come out with a result, said ZPC Munyati mentor Isaac Nyabvure.He has one of the most balanced sides in the league with a lot of youngsters who have shown potential at the same time with veteran players the likes of former Dynamos forward Jacob Muzokomba.His counterpart Themba Chingwena whose side consists of mainly students from the institution described today s game as a game of chances. We respect ZPC Munyati and with little to separate us from them judging by the results, it will be a game of chances. I have told my boys to make sure that they convert the chances that come our way if we are to come back with a result, said Chingwena.Elsewhere, former premiership side Border Strikers make a long trip to Gweru where they take on Whawha at the prisons and correctional services grounds.FixturesToday: TelOne vs Gwanda United (Wilson Fields), MSU vs ZPC Munyati (MSU), Chrome Stars vs Blanket Mine (Chrome), Ivan Hoe vs Makusha (Amaveni), Whawha vs Border Strikers (Whawha),Tomorrow: Black Eagles vs ZRP Gwanda (Simbi), Vumbachikwe vs Tongogara (Vumbachikwe), Silo United vs Nichrut (Mbizo), FC Platinum U19 vs Kwekwe Stars (Mandava) @lavuzigara1
