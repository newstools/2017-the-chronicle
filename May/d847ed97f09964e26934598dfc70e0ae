Each of you will serve an effective eight years in jail. This court has found overwhelming evidence that you committed the offence. In sentencing you, l considered that you are first offenders but armed robbery is a very serious offence and the use of a gun endangered people`s lives. A custodial sentence is the only suitable sentence for this offence, she said.Prosecuting, Ms Caroline Matanga said on April 1, at around 8PM, the trio pretended to be customers and asked for 25 grams of phenobarbitone from a pharmacist. As the complainant took the drug to show them, Sibanda drew a pistol and pointed it at the pharmacist and demanded cash. The complainant called his workmate Ms Caroline Chikerema who was counting money in the next office, she said. Sibanda pointed a gun at Ms Chikerema and force marched her back to the office where the money was and the other two accused persons followed them and took $642 which was on the table and went away. Ms Matanga said the pharmacist reported the matter to the police leading to the arrest of Ndlovu and Dube.- @cynthiamthembo1&nbsp;
