Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter BANTU Rovers captain Bukhosi Sibanda became the first player in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League to score a hat-trick this season when he led his side to a 7-2 rout of coachless Yadah FC at Luveve Stadium on Saturday. The three goals increased the young midfielder s goal tally to seven from the same number of games, making him the league s top goal scorer. He is only four goals shy of the 2016 Castle Lager Top Goal Scorer, veteran Leonard Tsipa, who bagged 11 goals. Sibanda s scoring prowess has been impressive for a side that is 16th on the league table with only six points.Sibanda opened his league s scoring account with a goal apiece against FC Platinum and Triangle. He then scored a brace in his side s 2-3 loss to Hwange before his weekend s hat-trick. I m shocked and excited at the same time that I have managed to score seven goals in seven outings. Each time I get onto the field, I always try to do my best and I believe that s the reason why I have managed to score more goals. There is nothing special except that I have managed to utilise the chances that I got from all the matches, as you know in football it s all about chances, said Sibanda.He was also quick to hail the contribution of his teammates. I want to thank my teammates because I wouldn t have scored these goals without their assistance and I hope we will be able to score more. We just take it one game at a time and see what comes out, he said.@khumzallen
