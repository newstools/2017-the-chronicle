Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter HYENAS are wreaking havoc in Binga, killing livestock and terrorising communities. This has forced some pupils not to attend school.Chief Siansali said some parents have stopped their children from attending school, fearing for their lives. School children are at risk as many of them walk long distances to school and are supposed to leave home at around 5AM. Many of them have resorted to going to school later during the day or not going at all than risk their lives. I am receiving reports of over 30 goats and sheep being killed in one night and this definitely needs an immediate solution. The situation has become unbearable and needs immediate intervention, said Chief Siansali. No culling has ever been done for the past 40 years and so far efforts to get assistance from national parks have not been successful. We are appealing to government to intervene through the national parks on this issue which has greatly affected villagers. These animals should be captured and put back into national parks where they belong. Chief Siansali said people were now desperate due to the hyena attacks. Mr Aaron Sikagazi lost 10 goats on Wednesday night, while Mr Justin Simoto of Nameso village lost five cattle on Thursday. Many other villagers are losing one, two or more livestock on a daily basis, he said.Mr Sikagazi said he was distressed at losing 10 goats in one night. We depend on livestock as our source of livelihood and so you can imagine the pain and stress I am going through right now. We sell goats to get money for school fees and this has come as a big blow to our communities. We use livestock to solve all economic and social issues as there is no other economic activity in the area, he said. The painful part is that these losses go without compensation. Campfire is now no longer functional as we don t receive proceeds that are supposed to come to us as the affected communities. @winnie_masara
