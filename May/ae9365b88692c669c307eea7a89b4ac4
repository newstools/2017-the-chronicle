Winky D! Winky D! as they wanted to see the Gafa on stage.After some minutes of the Vigilance band setting up their equipment, the party was about to start as people knew the Ninja President would deliver.Winky D seems to set the bar high whenever he is called upon to perform at any show, and this one was no different.The Messi weReggae as he calls himself is best described as the Barcelona Football Club talisman, who no matter how good you are will be better than you.Winky D is in a world of his own when it comes to performance and stage presence.
