Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau ChiefZANU-PF Midlands province is restructuring its cells and every party member, including those in the Politburo must be registered in a cell. Midlands provincial chairperson Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube yesterday said they were in the process of coming up with a data base using names of members registered in cells. We started a restructuring exercise in the province aimed at mobilising party members. We are recruiting new members and as such we have witnessed an increase in cells to about 564 from 465 last year, he said.Eng Ncube said they had taken a stance to concentrate on cells and even Politburo members were supposed to have their names appearing on cell registers. It doesn t matter what position you are in the party, your name should be at a cell register. As far as we are concerned those registered in the cells become our voters. The cell registers will be our voters roll. That s the way we are doing. All cells and districts are working and sending us information as we create our data base, he said.Eng Ncube said the party was going to roll out a campaign programme for the Chiwundura Constituency by-election tomorrow to make sure that the ruling party retains the seat.Zanu-PF s Cde Brown Ndlovu will battle it out with three other candidates who filed their nomination papers at the Nomination Court in Gweru last Friday for the July 15 by-election.Zanu-PF Midlands provincial party spokesperson, Cde Cornelius Mupereri said the revolutionary party was guaranteed victory in the 2018 elections as the party s membership continued to increase.Cde Mupereri said some people were dumping opposition parties which he said have been sprouting like mushrooms but have no track record to deliver.@pchitumba1
