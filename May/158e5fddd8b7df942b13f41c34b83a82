The late Johnstone Topi Joe ShumbaSikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A memorial football tournament for the late former Highlanders juniors and Hwange dribbling menace Johnstone Topi Joe Shumba will be held at Entumbane grounds today with four teams set to participate. Shumba, brother to 2010 Soccer Star of the Year Charles Sibanda, who is now with FC Platinum, and former Masvingo and Hwange midfield general Oswald Cargo Sibanda, died at Mpilo Hospital in April last year after a short illness at the age of 38. We will be holding a memorial football tournament for Topi Joe on Saturday at Entumbane Grounds (Esikwakweni). We expect four teams to take part; two from the suburb which he grew up in (Entumbane) and the other two from a selection of probably his peers that he socialised with, said Oswald, who flew into the country last week from his base in the United Kingdom for the memorial.Arguably one of the best dribblers to emerge from Entumbane suburb, Shumba was drafted into a then star-studded Hwange side in the early 2000s by coach Paul Moyo and easily endeared himself to the Hwange faithful through his rare dribbling wizardry, but had to hang his boots earlier than expected due to injury.It was that frustration of being forced to turn his back on the sport that he loved dearly that many still believe led to his eventual demise, as he suddenly became a heavy drinker, possibly to deal with the depression.He was a likeable character in the local neighbourhood and a number of football personalities are expected to grace the memorial tournament. @skhumoyo2000
