Cde KasukuwereAuxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, is set to crack the whip on some councillors in Chiredzi following the unearthing of corruption and fraudulent activities by an investigating team appointed by Government. The Minister told Parliament recently that he sent a team to the town after cases of corruption, mismanagement and fraud were raised by residents associations and stakeholders in Chiredzi Town.Cde Kasukuwere was responding to questions posed by Chiredzi West MP Darlington Chiwa in the National Assembly over alleged corruption and the use of septic tanks as a sewer reticulation system in the town.The Minister said an investigating team has concluded its work and he would be implementing its recommendations in due course. Mr Speaker Sir, may I inform the Hon Member that indeed, the Ministry is seized with the alleged cases of corruption, fraud and mismanagement of public affairs bedevilling Chiredzi Town Council. It was in response to the calls from the Hon Member and Chiredzi residents and Ratepayers Association that I deployed an investigation team to look into these cases of corruption from 29 March to 8 April 2017. I have had sight of the investigation report and the Ministry is already in the process of implementing recommendations from the report, said the Minister.On the use of septic tanks, Cde Kasukuwere said it is not Government policy for residents of high density suburbs to use septic tanks as a sewer reticulation system. Instead, the respective local authority should connect its residents to the conventional sewer reticulation system. The use of septic tanks in high density suburbs is strongly discouraged as it contaminates underground water, he said.Recently, residents accused Chiredzi councillors, seven from Zanu-PF and one from MDC-T, of allocating themselves 40 residential stands apiece.Residents threatened to demonstrate if Cde Kasukuwere failed to pass a verdict over the alleged corruption by the councillors.The Government has fired a number of councillors accused of corruption countrywide.Most of the councillors have been implicated in illegal land deals. @AuxiliaK
