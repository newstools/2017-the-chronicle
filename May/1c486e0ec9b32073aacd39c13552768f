Nation DubeTobias Mandoreba in Hwange Hwange 0-0 Triangle United A win at home again proved elusive for Hwange as the coalminers and visiting Triangle battled to a goalless draw in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at the Colliery Stadium yesterday.The miners might have picked up their first point at home this season, but will remain worried as they have now gone for 360 minutes of football action without a goal at home.Both teams started the match with clear intentions and each got clear headed opportunities in the opening five minutes, but Mcqini Mpofu for Hwange and the visitors Courage Dennias fluffed the opportunities.It then became a see-saw affair with Triangle getting their best chance of the day in the 22nd minute when Brian Juwayeyi released Dennias, who was, however, denied by Taimon Mvula from a one-on-one situation.The young goalie fisted the ball back into play and veteran defender Obert Moyo scooped it out for a corner.Triangle were not done as they again threatened the Hwange goal 10 minutes from halftime through Russell Madamombe, who unleashed a blistering 35m free kick, which again drew the best out of Mvula, who went airborne to tip the ball out for a corner.The introduction of Justine Kaunda for Mpofu in the 53th minute increased Hwange s attacking tempo as the hosts virtually camped in the Triangle half, with some incessant attacks, which overworked the visitors defence that was well marshalled by the defensive duo of Guthrie Zhokinyu and Kudzai Chigwida.Nomore Chinyerere s dipping free kick in the 63th minute eluded the Triangle defence, but alert goalkeeper Ronald Mudimu was equal to it.Hwange continued pinning Triangle in their own half with anchorman Collen Muleya producing the miss of the afternoon in the 78th minute when he latched onto a clever flick from Gilbert Zulu inside the box only for him to literally pass the ball into the hands of keeper Mudimu.Hwange coach Nation Dube said he drew some positives from the point gained at home. Everything has a starting point and the boys did well with the point gained today as they now believe it is possible to win at home. They played well only that we missed many chances, said Dube.His Triangle counterpart Taurai Mangwiro was also pleased with a point away from home. It was a winnable game in my opinion as we created some decent chances, but still I m a happy with a point as we have now gone four matches without a loss. Injuries also affected my game plan, Mangwiro said.Hwange-based referee Bekezela Makeka handled the match well with both teams expressing satisfaction with the officiating.TeamsHwange: T Mvula; A Banda; N Chinyerere; H Kaunda; C Phiri; O Moyo; C Muleya; S Gadzikwa (M Ncube 83th min); A Chuma; M Mpofu (J Kaunda 53th min); G ZuluTriangle: R Mudimu; D Dzvinyai; R Mhlanga; K Chigwida; G Zhokinyu; B Juwayeyi (N Meson 66th min); D Chirambamurivo; T Huwa; R Madamombe; J Chivasa (L Nhamo 60th min); C Dennias (B Maglasi 73th min). @tobymandox
