Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent BINGA Rural District Council (RDC) is set to introduce its first ever by-laws necessitated by the growth of the local authority. The council will be introducing hawkers and vendors, public health, communal land and livestock management and control as well as revenue collection by-laws.In an interview yesterday, Binga RDC chief executive officer Mr Joshua Muzamba said all along council has been using resolutions to run the local authority. Previously we did not have the by-laws but the growth of the town has forced us to introduce the by-laws. We are introducing the by-laws as a local authority to carry out and execute our service delivery function. Yes, we might have council resolutions which empower us to carry out certain activities but with by-laws decisions will be enforceable at law, said Mr Muzamba.He said the by-laws will enable council to effectively develop the area.Mr Muzamba said the management of livestock and control by-law will prohibit people from bringing their animals into town. Binga centre is a growing town. You ll find out there is livestock straying into the town. Therefore the livestock become a nuisance on the roads and may cause accidents especially during the night. So they are becoming a danger to our residents, said Mr Muzamba.He said the revenue collection by-law will guide the RDC on measures to adopt on debt collection.Mr Muzamba said there would be consultative meetings before the implementation of the by-laws.@nqotshili
