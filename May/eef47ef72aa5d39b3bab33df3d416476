Yes, about 42 people from five villages in Hwange District were tested after they showed some kind of symptoms, although none of them showed Ebola symptoms, he said. Most patients were admitted for three to four days and were given antibiotics and paracetamol. In some people, tests for malaria turned out negative. Dr Masuka said a health team was on the ground investigating. We want to establish if the cases came from one village or a cluster of homesteads. We are also conducting investigations if there were any public gatherings like funerals or church meetings in those areas where the cases came from to see whether there might be a certain bug that might have hit the area. Our health team is on high alert towards the seasonal changes, especially after so much rain. A lot of bugs may manifest and naturally people are bound to suffer from diseases such as viral colds, malaria and others, he said.@winnie_masara
