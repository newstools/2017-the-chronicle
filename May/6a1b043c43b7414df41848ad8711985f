I think it s through the grace of God that I won this race. I was not expecting it as it was my first time to compete in a full marathon. I just decided to give it a try some two months back and that was when I started to train.&#8221;Before I used to take part in 10km and 5 000 metre races as well as short distances. The race was not easy as I spent most of the time trailing the guys who were leading but I managed to keep with the pace and because I was a sprinter before I specialised in short distances, it gave me the advantage in the closing stages and I am very happy.&#8221;Chokore was dominant in the women category after crossing the line in 2hrs 53 mins 34sec to win $3 000.Olivia Chitate came second in 2hrs 54mins 50sec to walk home $2 000 richer while Lizzie Chokore, the sister of the eventual winner, was third in 2hrs 54mins 50sec.Bulawayo dominated the races with Fairbridge s Trust Chidomaya winning the 10km race in 28mins 04sec while Blessing Wilson and Trust Hove were second and third.The wheelchair race saw Elford Moyo coming out tops ahead of Samson Muroiwa and Munyaradzi Katiyo.Another JM Busha 54 Races National Peace Pledge Marathon is also scheduled for South Africa this weekend.&nbsp;
