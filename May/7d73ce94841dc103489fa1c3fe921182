Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter TWO elderly women from Lupane died after they were stung by a swarm of bees that had settled in one of their old wardrobes. The two, who were related were attacked by the bees at their home in Gomoza area, under Chief Menyezwa in Lupane. It is alleged that the bees went after them when the old wardrobe that they had occupied collapsed.Sithiyekile Ncube (84) died while admitted to St Luke s Hospital last Friday, two days after being attacked. Her niece, aged 65, whose identity was not immediately provided died last Thursday on her way to the hospital.Ncube is alleged to have remained seated as the bees attacked her while the younger woman escaped into one of their bedrooms to no avail.Matabeleland North Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka said: I can confirm that two elderly women died after they were stung by bees while sitting outside their house. We suspect that because of their old age, the two women failed to run away or protect themselves from the bees. They also took their time to seek medical attention. Dr Masuka said there was a possibility that, had they sought medical help on time, their lives could have been saved. People should seek medical attention as soon as they are attacked, be it by bees, snakes and other animals. Quick medical attention helps before poison spreads throughout their bodies. We urge members of the public to quickly seek medical attention after such incidents, he said.@winnie_masara
