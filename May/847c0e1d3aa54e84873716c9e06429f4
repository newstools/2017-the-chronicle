Shemeah MushiribindiMehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwe rugby referee Shemeah Mushiribindi s star continues to shine across the Limpopo River after he was appointed to officiate at the Coca-Cola Under-16 Grant Khomo Week at Grey College, Bloemfontein, in July. The 24-year-old from Bulawayo s Nketa suburb, but now domiciled in the Mpumalanga city of Emalahleni, formerly known as Witbank, expressed delight at being named among the match officials for the tournament, which runs from July 10-14. I am so excited because this is a huge step for me as a young up-and-coming referee. This is my first year in the Academy panel and I just got appointed to a National Week. I am so grateful, glory be to the Almighty, said Mushiribindi.His appointment to the Grant Khomo Week must come as an exciting moment for his mentor Simbarashe Dangah, who showed belief in the youngster from the time he took up rugby refereeing in 2010.Mushiribindi moved to South Africa last year at the invitation of Mpumalanga Rugby Referees chairman Steve Brits, a move which has really improved his officiating.Last year, Mushiribindi was assistant referee for the Currie Cup Under-21 match between the Pumas and Blue Bulls at Mbombela Stadium on September 10 before being appointed fourth official for the seniors fixture on the same day.His exploits in South Africa saw him named the 2016 Matabeleland Rugby Referees Society Referee of the Year at an awards ceremony held at Hartsfield on December 22, last year.Mushiribindi was back home recently to officiate at the Dairibord Schools Rugby Festival in Harare and also took charge of the biggest game of the opening weekend of the second term between Falcon College and Prince Edward in Esigodini.Meanwhile, national trials for players to represent Zimbabwe at the annual Coca-Cola Youth Weeks in South Africa next month will take place in Esigodini and Harare on Friday and Saturday.Zimbabwe will send four boys teams to the Under-13 Craven Week, Under-16 Grant Khomo Week, Under-18 Craven Week and Under-18 Academy Week.All four participating teams are being sponsored by Old Mutual.@Mdawini_29
