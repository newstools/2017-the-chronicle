Bongani Ndlovu Showbiz Correspondent Master Cecil Mine Bar was the place to be as Martin and the Ndolwane Super Sounds, Iyasa and Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services Ntabazinduna Band, spearheaded an HIV and Aids outreach programme on Saturday. The music gala was organised by the National Aids Council (NAC) targeting sex workers, artisanal miners and the community in Umguza district offering free HIV testing and counselling. Martin who recently released his second album Konke Sizokulungisa was the headline act at the music gala that was held in the afternoon.Organisers held the show in the afternoon because they are against night shows that promote unsafe sexual behaviour which puts people at risk of contracting HIV/Aids.Children were captivated by the dance moves from award winning Iyasa.Martin is popular in these parts and as he was singing songs that educate people about HIV Aids such as Abantwana, that they sang along word for word.However, ZPCS Ntabazinduna band got the crowd on their feet when they sang a rendition of the popular tune Ngamnanka by Madlela Skhobokhobo.In the event Madlela Skhobokhobo comes to Zimbabwe, he should hire this band to back him as they have the verve and flair that the song needs to get people on their feet.After the show Martin s manager Thandazani Nyoni said he was happy with the turn out and that people got tested. We were happy to meet our fans in remote areas like Master Cecil Mine. What makes us happy is that people enjoyed our music and the number of people who got tested was one of the highest according to NAC records making the event a success, said Nyoni.&nbsp;
