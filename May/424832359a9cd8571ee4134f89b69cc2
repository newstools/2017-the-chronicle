Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya The National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe (NAGZ) in Bulawayo will tomorrow hold a photographic exhibition themed Obaba Balamhla/Fathers of Today. The exhibition, a partnership between the gallery, Voices in Colours and Embassy of Sweden explores the roles of fathers in Zimbabwe and how their relationships with their partners and child(ren) have changed in the face of a changing and progressively more gender equal world.Director of Voices in Colours and curator of Obaba Balamhla, Mthabisi Phili said: The exhibition uses photography to portray a modern father whose role in the family goes beyond putting food on the table, but also getting involved in family interaction issues. It seeks to discuss the new role of fatherhood as it will also encourage them not to leave the role of raising children to mothers only, but also get involved in the upbringing of their children. Added NAGZ: The photographs show not just fathers having fun with their children, but taking care of them as well. Most fathers are acutely aware that their wives are taking the lion s share of the responsibility from the beginning of parenthood, and feel left out of the lives of their children and want to be involved more. Some see the mother acting as gatekeeper by asserting too much control over childcare and household decisions, therefore undermining the father s participation.
