Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Reporter A SOUTH African steel firm has expressed interest in doing business with the National Railways Zimbabwe (NRZ) and Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL). Triangle Profiling Steel, which was one of the first-time exhibitors at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) held in Bulawayo last month, says it is eager to establish business deals with NRZ and HCCL after being exposed to the opportunities in the two companies and the cordial relations between the two neigbouring countries.Company managing director, Mr Jacob Moleleki, told Business Chronicle that his team met management of HCCL and NRZ during the ZITF and discussed their interest. We are seeking good business deals with Zimbabwean companies. We had a meeting with the managing director of HCCL and a director at NRZ. I think these two companies can help us as a company to supply them with steel and other iron related products that can also help them to be viable, he said. In South Africa we supply Transnet and definitely it will mean good business deals to NRZ. Mr Moleleki said his company would be coming back to Zimbabwe for the Mine Entra exhibition in July to do a follow up on potential business deals. It will be an ideal thing to be part of growing the economy of Zimbabwe. We also want to set up operations here and this means lots of job opportunities will be created, said Mr Moleleki.HCCL and NRZ are among the biggest parastatals in Zimbabwe whose revival presents the potential to create more job opportunities. The two firms were once big employers before their fortunes nosedived.The two firms also impact on downstream industries along the value chain.@Kiyaz_Cool
